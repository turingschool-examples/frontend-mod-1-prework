### Chapter 5 Questions

1. **In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
  >The alt attribute provides a descriptive text of the image in case it does not load, providing context. This is both important for search engines and to be understood by screen reader software, used by people with visual impairments.

2. **What determines if an image element is inline or block?**
  >An image being inline or block is determined by its location in relation to the block element. If it sits before a block element, then the image starts on its own line. While, if the image is location _inside_ the block element, then the image actually flows with the text.

3. **What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?**
  >Jpeg image format is one of the most common formats for images online. Usually, images with many colors should use jpeg. Png images are usually logos, diagrams or illustrations that contain flat color. This would be the same color spread out over a large spread of the image.

### Chapter 16 Questions

1. **What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?**
  >Specifying heigh and width in CSS will be beneficial because it helps the sites load faster, given that the code tends lo load quicker than the site itself and that is extra information it has to use while rendering the page. Usually, there is a uniformity to the websites use of images overall. Because of this, it become convenient to use CSS for dimension control as a an overall class. Changes to the entire image bank will be uniform rather than going image by image editing. Good grief.

2. **What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?**
  >An image sprite is a single image that gets used repeatedly through an website. Usually things like logos can be sprites and can be interacted with by clicking. It is useful since it eases the load on the web browser while loading the page and makes a single request for multiple images. This makes loading faster overall.
