What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

  * In CSS, specifying the image size will help to load the pages more smoothly because the code will load before the image which allows it to render the page without waiting for the image to load. Compared to html if you were to size the image too big it can become distorted and grainy.

What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

  * An image *sprite* is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. This is useful because the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which in the end can help the page load faster.
