1. In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?

In case the user is unable to view the image, what is written in the alt element describes what the image is.

2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?

Where the image is placed. If it is followed by a block level element then the block level element will sit on a new line after the image is shown. If it is inside a block element any text or elements will flow around the image.

3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?

The advantage of using a JPG is that it is better suited for images with many different colors, such as nature photos. While a PNG is more suited for images with just a few of exactly the same color, known as flat colors.

Chapter 16

1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

The benefit of using CSS for height and width is that it will format all images on the page to the same size rather than being forced to change each single image in HTML to a set size.

2. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

Sprite is a single image used several different times in an interface. It is useful because it only needs to request one image rather than many resulting in a web page loading quicker.
