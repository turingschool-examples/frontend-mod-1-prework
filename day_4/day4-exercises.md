#### Chapter 5 on Images HTML questions;

1. The alt attribute in an image element is important because this will provide a text description if the image does not show up. This should give an accurate description so the reader software can understand what the image would look like. Also, if the image has no meaning, then the alt attribute should still be used, but the quotes to where the text would be, would be left empty.

2. What determines if an image element is inline or block is block always appears on a new line, while inline sits within a block level element and does not start a new line. A block example for an image element is when an image element is placed in HTML before a ``<p></p>``, that is when it will start a new line. An inline example for an image element is when an image element is placed in HTML at the start of a paragraph or placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

3. The benefits of jpg image file formats are jpg shows vibrant colors as well as being suitable for storage. There are so many colors in one picture and even though it might look like just one color, there are many colors within that color. Also, when it comes to storing a jpg file you can easily compress the image  with a similar resolution. That is why jpg is suitable for storage. The benefits of png image file formats are there is no loss in quality each time a file is opened, the degree of transparency can be controlled, and it is ideal for graphics because it will showcase the sharp edges and solid colors.

1. The benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS then specifying them in HTML is the rule will be specified for all small, medium, and large images instead of just one specific image. Also, since this is only kept in CSS it will only affect the presentation of the page and will not affect the HTML markup.

2. An image sprite is when an image is used for several different parts of an interface. This is useful because it helps to add multiple elements to the image without having the browser open multiples of that image, causing the page to load faster.
