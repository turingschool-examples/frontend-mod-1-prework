HTML images:

1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

It provides a text description of the image in case you can't see it.

2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?

Block would be on it's own line whereas inline sits within a block level element.

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?

Jpg and png are file extensions used across many websites and are safe file extensions to stick with if you're unsure.


CSS images:

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

The hight and width would then be the same across all pages as long as you're importing a stylesheet. This means less time coding.

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

A sprite is a single image used for many different parts of a site. This is useful because the site only has to pull one image instead of multiple which means faster load times.
