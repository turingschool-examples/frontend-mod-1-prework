1. Alt attributes are important because they provide descriptions of images for people who arenâ€™t able to see an image. It makes websites more accessible.
2. Images are inline elements by default. You can use CSS to change an image into a block element (display: block).
3. You should use .jpg if you have an image with a lot of colors. You should use .png (or .gif) when a picture has few colors or large areas of the same color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams are usually saved as .png and photos are usually saved as .jpg.

1. CSS allows you to set size rules for multiple images instead of having to do so one at a time. You should typically use CSS to modify all of your content and only use HTML to indicate what content is there.

2. Sprites are images that you use in several different parts of an interface. Using sprites can help a page load faster because it is only loading one image as opposed to several.
