<h2> Chapter 5: Images HTML</h2>

<p><h3>In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?</h3></p>
<i> The <b>alt</b> attribute is typically used to help people with visual impairments that use screen reader software to know what the image is showing without actually seeing it.</i>  


<p><h3>What determines if an image element is inline or block?</h3></p>
<i>As < img > element itself is an inline element its placement will determine  if it will show as inline or block element if you place image element before a block element like < p > element it will act as a block element but if you put it inside the < p > element it will show up inline with the rest of the content. </i>


<p><h3>What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?</h3></p>
<i><b>Jpg</b> format carries more data and is better suited for images that have many colors and not a lot of flat colors. For example its good to used jpg format for images that have snow or sky. <b>png</b> format is best used for images with a lot of flat colors or images that have a lot of the same color. For example logos or charts.</i>



<h2>Chapter 16 on Images CSS</h2>

<p><h3>What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
</h3></p> There are a number of reason to use CSS to control height and width of images. One of them is you keep content separate from styling. You can also control image size based on predetermined classes and target selectors with CSS, this gives you ability to control width/hight of multiple images at the same time.</i>


<p><h3>What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
</h3></p> Sprite is an optimization technique that allows you to reuse multiple images in one reference  image file. This is useful for things like button or icons that change behavior when you push them or hoover over them. This technical benefit is ability to reduce the load times and browser requests as you only need to load one image vs a number of images.</i>
