## Chapter 5 questions:

### In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
The alt provides a text description of the element. This is important because when the image doesn't work on the page, this text will show instead. That way, when you go to fix the problem, you know exactly what image you're working with, and you don't have to go searching for it in your code.


### What determines if an image element is inline or block?
What determines if an image is inline or block is going to be where the image element sits in the code. If the image element is followed by a block element like `<p> or <h1>` then it will sit on it's own line, making it block. If the image element sits inside a block element then it will be inline because the other elements will flow around the image.

### What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?
The jpg file formats are really great for images with a lot of different colors in them. Where as png should be done with images containing less colors or a lot of the same color. Png file format is good for images that are slightly transparent or or have a drop-shadow.

## Chapter 16 questions:

### What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
The benefit of using CSS to specify the height and width is that you don't have to write it in every image. You can write in CSS a set height and width for multiple images. Since it's pretty common to have a lot of images on a page be the some dimensions. CSS will also tell the browser how much space to leave for the image before it loads. That way you don't have to wait for it to load and have things be shifting around while images show up.


### What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
An image sprite is the use of one image across the site. It might be a logo that is at the top of every page or an image that you can click on every page. This is useful because since images have loading time, using one across the site makes the loading time faster.
