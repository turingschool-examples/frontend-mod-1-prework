## In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
An alt attribute provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. This also helps search engines understand the image content.

## What determines if an image element is inline or block?
Block elements always appear on a new line. Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.

## What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?

## What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
HTML and CSS code will load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to load.

## What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
An image sprite is a single image used for several different parts of an interface. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many, which can make the web page load faster.
