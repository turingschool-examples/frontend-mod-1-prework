Chapter 5:
1. The `alt` attribute allows for vision-impaired users or those using screen readers to also interact with the image, since it describes it.
2. If an `<img>` is followed by a block, then the image will be treated like a block. If the image is inside a block-level element, then it will be inline.
3. A `jpg` works best for images with lots of different colors in them. A `gif` or `png` works best for images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

Chapter 16:
1. Pages load more smoothly when the image height and width are specified with CSS. It makes it so the space for the image loads before the image, so things don't shift around as the page loads.
2. An image sprite is one image that is used to make a button or link visually change when the user interacts with it, by moving the image and only showing part of it depending on how the user is interacting with it.
