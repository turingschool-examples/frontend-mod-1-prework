# Day 4: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Answer these questions about the reading in your `day4-exercises.md` file:

1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
* It is important to the visually impaired as it adds a description to the image for screen reading software.

2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?
* Positioning of the ``<img>``; A block ``<img>`` starts on it's own line and is followed by a block-level element.  Whereas an inline <img> sits within or inside a block-level element and does not start a new line.

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
* Photographs that use many different colors are best saved as `jpg`.
* Illustrations or logos that use flat, few or large areas of the same color are best saved as `png` or `gif`.

Answer these questions about the reading in your `day4-exercises.md` file:

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
* It allows the rest of the page to load more smoothly based on the ``<img>`` dimensions, without waiting for the image to download.

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
* An image sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface.
* This is useful since it can make the page load faster because the browser only needs to request one image vs many.
