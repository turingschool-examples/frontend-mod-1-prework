1.  **In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?**
  The `alt` attribute includes text that can substitute the image in case the reader can't see the image. This helps in case the image doesn't load or if the user is using a reader to describe the page contents.
2.  **What determines if an image element is inline or block?**
  An image will display differently depending on the surrounding code. If a block element is placed after the image (or ends before the image), the image will be a block element. If it is inserted inside an existing block element or isn't followed by a new block element, it will appear inline.
3.  **What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?**
  .jpg images are able to display many colors at a smaller file size than .png. However, .png files can have transparency which can be useful if you only want a portion of the image to show up.


1.  **What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?**
  When doing it in CSS, you can consistently change the size of images with less effort and less code. Using HTML you have to specify the dimensions in for every image file.
2.  **What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?**
  An image sprite is a single image used in many areas of the site. It is useful because a web browser only needs to request that one image as opposed to multiple which can make the page load faster.
