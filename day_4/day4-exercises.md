HTML Images:

1) In an HTML image the alt attribute is responsible for providing a text description of that image if you can not see the image. This text is often referred to as alt text and is important because it allows for screen reader software to understand an image and relay it back to someone who is visually impaired.

2) If an image starts or is followed by a new line it is a block element because block elements always appear on a new line. If the image is inline it will then sit within a block level element and won't start a new line. If an image is inside text it will flow around the image and again won't cause a new line to start.

3) One benefit of using jpg is it allows for a lot of different colors and contrasts in a picture. When you think of a photograph, with deep rich contrasts, colors and shadows, that's the best mental model for a jpg. Whereas, an png is great when saving and using images with few colors or a large area of the same color. This is because using png allows for a smaller file size.


CSS Images:

1) To start with, using CSS to specify the height and width of images is that when you need to have your pictures all be the same size across your site you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images instead is having to put them over and over again in the HTML. Along with this you can more easily align or center images using CSS. You can even place a background-image behind any HTML element using CSS. It can be the whole page or even just a portion of one due to the control the CSS has over the boxes they represent. CSS also introduces the ability to specify a gradient/ contrast for the background of a box including an image.     

2) An image sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. This can encompass things such as the logo, buttons to the image, and other interface elements. The advantage to using sprites is that the web browser will only need to get one image rather than many images, which in turn help the page load more quickly.
