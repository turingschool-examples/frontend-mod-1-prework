1. *What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?* If you specify the height and width of an image in CSS rather than HTML, it's easier to make changes to more than one image at a time. You can also determine the width and height of more than one image. It also allows the HTML page to only have code that focuses on structure, while the style sheet focuses on style.
2. *What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?* Image sprites use a single image file to show different images depending on the user's activity. When using image sprites, the page can load faster because only one file needs to load, not multiple.
