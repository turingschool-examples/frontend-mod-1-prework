# Day 4 Exercises

## Chapter 5
1.  The 'alt' attribute is important for accessibility reasons. if the person visiting the web site cannot see it, the alt tag will have their screen reader read the alt tag here.
2.  Two things to help determine wheather an image is inline or a block. The first thing is where the img tag is located. If it is inside a block level element, any text will flow around it. If it is outside the block level element, it will stay out side the text. The other thing that helps decide if the img is treated as an inline element, is the align attribute.  This tell how the other elements on the page will flow around it.
3.  The benefits of each img type are as follows:
    - jpg: Is better for images with alot of colors. 
    - png: much better for less colors, smaller img files so they will load faster. 

## Chapter 16
1.  The benefit of doing img sizing is CSS is because the page will load more smoothly than. Letting the browser know how much space to leave for the img is important, since the rest of the page can load.
2.  An img sprite is when a single img is used for several parts of an interface. It can be useful because the browser only has to load the image one time. This will save some time if you can load it once and put it in 5 other places at the same time.
