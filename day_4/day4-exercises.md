## In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
* The `alt` attribute is important in image elements because it provides a description of the image for those using screen reader software.
## What determines if an image element is inline or block?
* Image elements that are followed by a block level element will proceed the block level element, which will then sit on a new line after the image. If an image element is inside of a block level element, the other inline elements will flow around the image.
## What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
* `jpg` images are good when you're using a photograph that contains many different colors, and when the image has slight variations in color, such as a landscape or photo of the sky. `png` files are often used when the image has "flat colors", which are common in logos or illustrations.

## What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
* Specifying the height and width of images in CSS is beneficial because you can use consistently sized images across an entire site. This is helpful when you have multiple images across the site that you want to appear as the same size, and you can simply group them together in CSS so they all appear as the same size.
## What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
* Using an image sprite is useful when you have multiple small images that need to change or display differently depending on the actions of the user. By using an image sprite and defining the position of the sprite based on the action of the user, the page will only have to change the position of the one sprite image that is already loaded, instead of loading a different image altogether.
