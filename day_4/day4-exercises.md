1. In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?

The alt attribute gives the image a name in text in case the defined image is having trouble loading.

2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?

The location of where the code for the image determines whether it is given its own unique line (block), or whether it is incorporated within another element (inline). For example if you begin the code with <p>, then place the image source within that, the image will pop up on the same line as the paragraph text.

3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?

A jpg image format is beneficial when using images with many colors, such as actual photos or elaborate paintings/drawings. The png format works best with images containing less broad of color scheme, like logos and diagrams.

4. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

Since many images on a website are typically the same size, it is more efficient to just specify dimensions in fewer lines on CSS instead of specifying individual dimensions for each image in HTML

5. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

An image sprite is when you use a singular image multiple times, the example the book gives is a unique image used for buttons. This can be beneficial when coding because the browser will only need to request the image once instead of multiple times for each time the image is repeated, making loading times faster.
