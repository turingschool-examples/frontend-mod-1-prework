### 1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

#### 1. Specifying image sizes help the page load more smoothly because the code will often load before the images. It also tells the browser how much space to leave for an image allowing it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. CSS will allow you to resize multiple images versus having to write code for each image in HTML speeding up your production.
