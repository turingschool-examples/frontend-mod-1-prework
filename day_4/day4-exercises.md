**HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites**

1. Part 1

**In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?**

The `alt` attribute is important because it provides a text description of the image which can be helpful if you cannot see it. It is also referred to as `alt text`. This should give you an accurate description of what the image entails so it can be read by screen reader software and search engines.

**What determines if an image element is inline or block?**

What determines if an image is inline of block is that a block element will always appear on a new line. This helps if the `<img>` is followed by a block level element. Then the block level will sit on a new line after the image is shown. An inline element will sit within a block level element and does not start on a new line.  

**What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?**

The benefits of `jpg` is when you are trying to upload an image with many different colors.The benefits of using `png` when you are saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

2. Part 2

**What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?**

The benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in HTML is that when you specify the image size, it will help the pages to load more smoothly because the code will often load before the images. It also tells the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the page without waiting for the image to reload.  

**What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?**

An image sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. It is useful because you can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image. Another advantage is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which in turn can make the webpage load faster.
