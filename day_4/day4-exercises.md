1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

    The 'alt' attribute provides a text description of the images if the user cannot see them. This should give an accurate description of the image for screen readers and search engines.

2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?

    Where the img element is placed determines how it is displayed. If the image is placed before a block element such as <p> or <h1> it will appear on it's own line. If placed within a block element any other elements will flow around that image.

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?

    The jpg format is great for images that have a lot of color and nuance while png is great for images that have flat color, or large areas of the same color.

Questions Pertaining to Chapter 16.

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

    This is really cool. So HTML and CSS load faster than images, by specifying the size of an image in CSS the page can save that space while it loads everything else. This also helps when you are using consistently sized images across your site.

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

    I have always thought of a sprite as a placeholder or generic digital asset. Here an image sprite is a single image used for several different parts of an interface. This also helps with load time as the browser only needs to request one image.
