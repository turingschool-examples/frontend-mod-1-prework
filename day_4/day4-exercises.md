1. The alt attribute is important because it provides a text description of the image for people who aren't able to see it. It should give an accurate description of the image so that it can be understood by screen reader software to be used by people with visual impairments.
2. If an image is followed by a block level element then the block level element will be shown on a new line after the image. If the image element is inside of a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image.
3. You should use jpg if you have a picture that has a lot of different colors. You should use png if you are using an image with few colors or large areas of the same color.

## Chapter 16
1. It is beneficial to specify the height and width of images in CSS vs. in HTML because instead of using the width and height attributes where the image elements appear in the HTML, you can use the names as values for the class attribute. Then in CSS you can add selectors for each of the class names, and use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.
2. An image sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. This is useful because the web browser will only need to request the one image instead of many, which can make the web page load faster.
