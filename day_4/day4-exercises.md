## Day 4 Exercises

### Images HTML

#### 1. In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
The alt attribute is important because it can tell screen readers what the image is about. The alt attribute allows people with visual impairments to understand what the image is about in relation to the content.

#### 2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?
If an image element is placed outside of an inline element then it will appear as a block level element. If the image is inside of an inline element, it will display as an inline-element.

#### 3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?
JPG images are better suited for photography or images with a lot of colors. PNG image formats are better suited for images with few colors or transparencies.

### Images CSS

#### 1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
The benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS is that CSS often loads before an image finishes loading. This allows the CSS to declare the space in the browser for the image. This helps eliminate content jumping around as different images or sections load onto the page.

#### 2. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
An image sprite is an image that contains multiple views or displays of the image. Some advantages of using sprites is that the browser only has to request one image. You can specify the background image on a button to change on hover, it will change the appearance of the button as the user hovers over the button.
