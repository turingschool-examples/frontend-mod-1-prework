Answer these questions about the reading in your `day4-exercises.md` file:

1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?

- the <alt /> attribute provides a written description of the image if the image cannot be seen.  An unseen image could be due many different reasons ranging from technical issues, to  visual impairment, or due to environmental condititions.

2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?

- Where, in the HTML document, the code for the image is placed, effects neighboring elements in different ways, therefore the placement yeilds different results depending on what else is already there.  

- Images are inherently inline elements, and act accordinly if placed within a block element.  

- If an image is followed by a block element, instead of content wrapping around the image, the block element's content will sit on a new line.    

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?

- They are the most common formats found among websites. 
- This assures that the page will load faster than it would if a different, less common format has been used.  
- THey will have a sharper appearance as opposed to a less common file format.

## Read Chapter 16 on Images CSS from [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett)

Answer these questions about the reading in your `day4-exercises.md` file:

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

- It allows you to categorize different sizes of images, for example, small, medium, large and control them easily from CSS. 
- Because these classes and the sizes of your pictures have been properly classified and organized in CSS, your page loads more quickly as opposed to loading each individual image's height and width which would take longer.

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?

- An image sprite is a single image that is used in other parts of the user interface. 
- It is useful because the browser only needs to download the image once for it to be used on the page which minimizes the amount of files the browser needs to download thus making load times much faster.
