1. When using an image element, the `alt` attribute allows text readers and search engines to know what the image is, and it also provides information if the image fails to load for the user.
2. Where the image is placed will determine if it is an inline or a block element. If the image is placed before a paragraph, it will sit above the paragraph, but if it placed within a paragraph, it will sit within the paragraph just as if it were a piece of text.
3. JPEG formats are useful when there are many different colors in the picture, and PNG format is useful for images that have few colors or only one color.

1. Images may take longer to load than the text on a page, so by specifying the height and width of an image in CSS, the layout will have that space reserved for the image as it loads.
2. An image sprite is a way of stacking images so that one one image appears at a time, but different images are called to the space by the user's actions. This is useful because it allows multiple images to be treated as one image file, reducing the amount of memory needed, and allowing for faster loading.
