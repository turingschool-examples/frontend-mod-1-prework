## Read Chapter 5 on Images HTML from HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites
### Answer these questions about the reading in your day4-exercises.md file:

1. __In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?__<br />
An image element must carry the following two attributes: src and alt. The alt attribute is important because it provides a text description of the actual image especially if you cannot see it. This allows it to be understood by screen reader software (used for visual impairments) and search engines.
2. __What determines if an image element is inline or block?__<br />
Browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways, block or inline. If the image is followed by a block level element, such as p or h1, then the block level element will sit on an entirely new line after the actual image/img element. Whereas an inline element sitw within the actual code of the block level element and will not sit on on its own line. It might be at the beginning of a paragraph but the bottom of the omage will line up with the text of currrent paragraph or somewhere in the middle of a paragraph with text flowing around the image.  
3. __What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?__
<br />To provide the right size format and resolution insuring that it looks its best on any given website. JPEG/JPG are good with many different colors in a picture that are subtly different. PNG is better with fewer colors or large areas of the same color.
