# Day 4 Exercises

### Chapter 5
1. The ‘alt’ attribute is important because it describes a summary about the picture incase you can not properly see the picture.
2. The placement of the code determines where the image will appear on the webpage. Placing the image element before the `<p>` element makes it block on its own line. Placing the image element inside of the `<p>` element causes it to be inline with the text of the paragraph.
3. Real life pictures, like those of nature that typically have a lot of color, are better seen if formatted in jpg. Images that contain a lot of flat color, like logos or diagrams, are preferably displayed in a png format.

### Chapter 16
1. If you specify the height and width in CSS, you can be more specific and set the size to the exact pixels you want it to be, versus just setting it to the small, medium, or large preset in HTML.
2. An image sprite is a way to simplify how a webpage shows certain elements that have different properties to them. This is typical when creating buttons on a webpage that have different physical appearances if you hover over the button, if you click on the button, or if the button is just on the page. Using a sprite combines all the images into 1 element, versus 3 or 5 or more images. This can help the webpage load all elements more quickly due to only downloading 1 image versus 5 or 6 or more images.
