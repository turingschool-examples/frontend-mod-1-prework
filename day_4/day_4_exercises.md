## Chapter 5:  

1. The alt attribute is important in an image element because it provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it - I'm assuming this would be very beneficial to people with disabilities.  
2. Block elements always appear on a new line, and inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line. So if you put your img before a paragraph, it will be block. If it is inside the start of a paragraph, or in the middle of the paragraph, it will be inline.  
3. The benefits of jpg is that it will show many of the necessary colors within an image very well. The benefit of png is that they work well with images with little or flat colors.  

## Chapter 16:  
1. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.  
2. When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the webpage load faster.
