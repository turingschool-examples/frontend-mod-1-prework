//example: Write a function below that, when called will print your name
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();

// Update the function below so that it takes an argument of your name and
//prints your name

function printName() {
  console.log("Brian Andrew Forbes")
};

printName()

// Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints their sum, and
// then call that function.
function addNum(num1, num2) {
  var num1 = 2
  var num2 = 4
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}
//YOUR CODE HERE

// Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.

/*I decided to use more than two strings for the above exercise. For context, the variables listed above
are all names of D&D characters in my weekly game, and Best Friends Club is the name of our adventuring party.
