## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
- A function allows us to write a code black that can be called back to later, or multiple times. It saves us from writing the same code multiple times.

2. What is a parameter?
- A parameter is a value listed in that functions definition, and acts as a variable.

3. What is a return value?
- A return value is like an instant stop command. It also takes the place of `undefined` in an empty function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
```
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am")
};
```

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```
function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
};

helloSomeone("Sam");
```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

`helloSomeone("Sam");`

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

N/A :)
