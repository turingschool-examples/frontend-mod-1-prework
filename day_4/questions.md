## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

  A function is a code block that performs a specific task.

1. What is a parameter?

  In a function parameters are similar to variables. Parameters go in parentheses after the function name. They give information that the function needs to operate.

1. What is a return value?

   A return value is what is passed back to the code that called for the function to be run.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will    print `"Sam I am"`.

function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}

hello()

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function hello_someone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
}

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

hello_someone(Derek)

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

  I think I have a fairly good grasp on functions. I just need to practice them more to get more experience and so that I can write them without referring to my notes.
