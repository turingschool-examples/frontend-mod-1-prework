It also allows for information to be passed to and from it.
2. What is a parameter?
A parameter is a variable that is passed into a function.
3. What is a return value?
A return vaule is a variable that is passed back from the function to where it was called from.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
function hello(){
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
