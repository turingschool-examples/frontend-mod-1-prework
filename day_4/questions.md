## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
A function take multiple data types and will combine them into 1 simpler output. This saves a lot of time by being able to simply type out the function name as a variable instead of rewriting the whole block of code again.

2. What is a parameter?
A parameter is the variable that you input into a function that will vary the outcome of said function.

3. What is a return value?
A return value is the output/code logged after the function has been ran.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
function hello(){
  console.log("Sam I am")
};

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
function helloSomeone(name){
  console.log(name + " I am")
};

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
helloSomeone(Joshua)

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
 Could we just use a loop instead of a function?
