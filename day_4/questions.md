## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
The purpose of a function is to perform a set action using inputs that might change every time the script is run.
It is also something that can be reused multiple times, such as calculating area of a rectangle multiple times with
different inputs.

1. What is a parameter?
A parameter is information that is passed to a function that allows the function to complete its task.

1. What is a return value?
A return value is the answer you get from a function that is run.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function hello_someone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am.");
}

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

hello_someone(Taryn);

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

Is there a difference between console.log and return when you are asking for a function to print or log a result?
I know return will stop a function immediately but console.log won't, I am just wondering if that matters in the
questions you have given us to answer in these questions.
