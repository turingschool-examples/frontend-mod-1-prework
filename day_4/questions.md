## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
- A function is a collection of statements that allow you to perform a specific task
within a script. If the task is repeated later on, you can reuse the same function.
This simplifies the amount of code that needs to be written.

1. What is a parameter?
- A parameter is the information that is used by the function.

1. What is a return value?
- The return value is the value that is returned when the function is called upon.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```Javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

hello("Sam I am");
```
1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```Javascript
function hello_someone(name) {
  return console.log(name + " I am");
}
```
1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
```Javascript
hello_someone("Mike");
```
1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
- I don't know what I don't know. Know what I mean? I know that this is an important concept
in coding. I will be further researching the topic so that I have a clearer understanding
going into Mod 1. The hardest example for me was the Albus Dumbledore one. I had difficulty with having the string within the function being called. I reached out to a coding friend to help me
understand the topic a little clearer. But I'm not there just yet!
