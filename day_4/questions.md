## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
Functions are used to group together code for a specific task. This can be helpful for repetition or instances where you need the user to enter feedback, etc..

1. What is a parameter?
A parameter is a field of view for a function. You can have a local parameter where a function only calls on a variable defined inside the function, or a global parameter where a function can call a variable from anywhere in the script.

1. What is a return value?
A return value is basically a response to a variable. If no return value is proper for the variable, it returns "undefined".

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
function hello("Sam I am") {
  console.log(hello)
};

hello();

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
var name = "Jam";
function hello_someone(name, " I am") {
console.log (name + " I am");
};
hello_someone(name);


1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
hello_someone(name);

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
I think I am still a little confused by syntax. I think with more studying I should get it fairly easily. Some of the stuff I have been stuck on has been easy enough to figure out with rereading and help from friends.
