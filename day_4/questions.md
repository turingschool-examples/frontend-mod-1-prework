## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
The purpose of a function is to provide a formulaic foundation for tasks to bet set in.

1. What is a parameter?
Parameters are pieces of information passed to a function. The name of the function is followed by parentheses, and within these parentheses exists the parameters. Inside the function those words act like variable names.

1. What is a return value?
The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function. The return value is the response (or answer) given by the function.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

function hello ( ) {
console.log ("Sam I am");
};

hello( );

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function hello_someone(name) {
var name = "name";
console.log(name + " I am ");
};


1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

hello_someone();

I have many questions that seem to be continuously solved through trial and error. Albeit inefficient, it's starting to make more sense.
