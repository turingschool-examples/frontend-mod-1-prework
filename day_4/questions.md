## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
  * a function is used to run a group of statements together to perform a specific task.

2. What is a parameter?
  * a ``parameter`` is the data a ``function`` needs to know in order to work. this data is placed inside parentheses ``()`` following the ``function keyword``.

3. What is a return value?
  * ``return value`` is a value returned to the use after a ``return statement`` is used in a function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
  *
  ``` Javascript
  function hello() {
    return "Sam I am"
  };
```

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
  *
  ```Javascript
var name = Sam

function hellosomeone() {
  console.log(name + " I am")
}
```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
  * ``helloSomeone()``

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
  * no questions as far as the very shallow depth of ``functions`` that we are currently on.
