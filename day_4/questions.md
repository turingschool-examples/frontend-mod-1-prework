## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

  * The purpose of a function is to group together a series of statements to perform a specific function. This helps organize the code and store the steps needed to achieve a task.

1. What is a parameter?

  * A __parameter__ is a piece of information passed to a function.

1. What is a return value?

  * When a function is expected to give an answer, that answer is the __return value__.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  * function hello() {
    console.log("Sam I am");
  };
  hello();

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
  * function helloSomeone(name){
    var name = ("Sam");
    console.log(name + "I am")
  }


1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
  * You could call or execute the function by putting __"helloSomeone();"__ after the code block.

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
  * So far this concept has taken me the longest to grasp. I've had to take multiple breaks and come back to this.
  * Too many times I was thwarted because I forgot to turn code into comments. Because of that, a lot of times my functions did not run because of a function that ran from a different set of code. Thankfully i finally realized the mistake and things are much clearer now.
