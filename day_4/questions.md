1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
A function takes a potentially long list of code/commands and allows it all to be used with the use of one command.
1. What is a parameter?
A parameter is a piece of information that is passed to the function via the call command for the function.
1. What is a return value?
A return value is the answer or response of a function.
1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
function hello_someone(name) {
function hello_someone(name) {
    var helloIAm = [name + "I am"];
    console.log(helloIAm);
}
1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
hello_someone('Jordy');
1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
