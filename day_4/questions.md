## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

The purpose of a function is to save you having to rewrite code that you know will be used multiple times in a program. It's a pseudo-subprogram within your own code that can be implemented without effecting the variables declared outside of it's code block.

2. What is a parameter?

Parameters are variables used when the function is declared, in order to specify what the function will be acting upon.

3. What is a return value?

A return value is what will be printed when the function completes its calculation/concatenation. The return value defines what will take place utilizing the parameters or arguments of the function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

function hello(string) {
  return "Sam I am";
}
hello();

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am");
}


6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

helloSomeone("Daniel");

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

I'm honestly not sure what to ask right now as I have so much to learn that asking it before I'd had time to riffle through all the information available to me and take down my own notes seems a bit ridiculous. I'm sure I'll be asking plenty of them soon enough!
