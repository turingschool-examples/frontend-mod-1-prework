## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?  
Functions allow you to group code together to perform a specific task. The purpose is to help organize your code, so you aren't re-writing code everywhere if you use the function more than once.

2. What is a parameter?  

Parameters are pieces of information passed to a function to perform its task.

3. What is a return value?  

Return values are the expected responses or answers from a function.

4. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
hello();
```

5. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.  

```javascript
function hello_someone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
}
hello_someone("Kelsie");
```

6. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?  

```javascript
hello_someone("Kelsie"); // this line of code is "calling the function".
```

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?    

I would like to understand more about arguments and parameters and what it means to "take an argument". I am getting it confused with a parameter.
