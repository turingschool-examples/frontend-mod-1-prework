## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?  
A function allows you to create a new scope that doesn't follow or change the regular flow of execution outside of it.

2. What is a parameter?  
A parameter is the data provided inside the parentheses that gives a method the information it needs in order to work.

3. What is a return value?  
The return statement returns a value to the function caller and ends function execution.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
```JavaScript
function hello(){
  return "Sam I am";
};
hello();
```

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```JavaScript
var name = "Tashia"

function helloSomeone(){
  return (name + " I am");
};
helloSomeone();
```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
```JavaScript
helloSomeone();
```

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?  
Nothing right now... just need more practice!
