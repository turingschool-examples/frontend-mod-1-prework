## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

  A function is a series of instructions that can be repeated based on the parameters the function is given. A function performs a specific task related to the data it uses.

1. What is a parameter?

  A parameter is a piece of information passed to and used by a function.

1. What is a return value?

  The response given by a function when you expect it to give you an answer. This is common with functions that conduct calculations.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  function hello() {
    console.log("Sam I am");
  };


1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

  function hello_someone(name) {
    console.log(name + " I am")
  }

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

  hello_someone();

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

  This has been the trickiest day of the work so far. I got things to work by using a bit of trial and error, so I think I understand the basics of how to make a function happen. I still need to work on my conceptual understanding though.
