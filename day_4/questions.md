## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

_A `function` is designed to hold a series of statements together for future reference. Its purpose it to store that information so you can run those statements multiple times with different input and outcomes._  

2. What is a parameter?

_A `parameter` is a piece of information that is passed to a function, for the function to be able to perform its task._

3. What is a return value?

_A `return value` is the `functions` response. The outcome of the function once parameters are provided._

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

```javascript
function hello(){
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
hello();
```

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

```javascript
function helloSomeone(name){
  console.log(name + " I am");
}
helloSomeone();
```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

_You would simple add a name to the `helloSomeone` function._

```javascript
function helloSomeone(name){
  console.log(name + " I am");
}
helloSomeone("Kevin");
```


7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

Nothing really comes up right away! I am definitely excited to play around a little more with functions. I am sure questions will arise then!
