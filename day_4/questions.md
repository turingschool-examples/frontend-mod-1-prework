## Day 4 Questions

#### 1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
- A function to me is basically a variable but it allows for more complex options

#### 2. What is a parameter?
- A parameter is an empty variable that is set/created when declaring a function
- Parameters act as placeholders when declaring functions so that when you need to call a function you can add your global variable or raw global data into the parentheses where the parameters went and the parentheses will pass the new data into the function's code. This makes a parameter similar to the place in the Starship Enterprise where the Star Trek characters step on in order to be "beamed" into another location. In this metaphor the parentheses would be the Starship Enterprise steppy thing and place inside the code where the parameters are located would be the new/desired destination

#### 3. What is a return value?
- A return value is any value that we receive resulting from using any function

#### 4. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
- `function hello(){console.log("Sam I " + "am");}`

#### 5. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
- `function helloSomeone(name){console.log(name + " I am");}`

#### 6. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
```
var me = "Chris"
helloSomeone(me);
```
#### 7. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
- None at this time
