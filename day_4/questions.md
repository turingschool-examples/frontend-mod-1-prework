## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

A function is mean't to provide a bubble of information and tools to be plugged in to an environment.  They seem like
they are clean and neat the way that they plug into code making things much more manageable and mutable.

2. What is a parameter?

The paramater is the specifications of the function, like the height and weight value or the name value. They act like variable names.

3. What is a return value?

The result of the function when called by the larger code.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

helloSomeone("Sam I am");

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

helloSomeone("Sam I am");

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

I guess I really just don't understand the point of arguments.  Maybe its just the limited examples that I have access to but I spent almost an hour on this section and I just don't  quite understand why I would use an argument.  I have an experienced computer programer friend who I asked to come over and maybe he can share some insight into them.
