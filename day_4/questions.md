1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
A function adds efficiency to a project by allowing for condensation of common blocks into a single command.
1. What is a parameter?
A parameter is a variable you assign each time you run a function, as it is varying information the function needs to run.

It's an answer expected from a function.
1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
function hello_someone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am");
};
1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
hello_someone("Yoda,");
1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
The return command. I'm still not fully sure I understand it. Does it log to the console or just to the function?
