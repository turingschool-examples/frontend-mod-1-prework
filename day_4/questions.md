## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

    * Similar to a function in math, it performs a task based on the parameters that are given. And it is repeatable.

1. What is a parameter?

    * A parameter is a piece of information that is provided in order to perform a function.

1. What is a return value?

    * Return value is very similar to an "answer" in math. It doesn't print the value, but holds it to be used later in the code. If you don't use the `return` key word, it will return undefined.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    ```
      function hello() {
          console.log("Sam I am");
        };

      hello();
    ```

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

    ```
    function helloSomeone(name) {
      return name + " I am";

    }
    ```

    // do I need to put console.log here? 

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

    ```
    helloSomeone();
    ```

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

    * I am fairly certain that I am not understanding how to do functions with strings. I think I have it down ok for functions that involve math/numbers.
