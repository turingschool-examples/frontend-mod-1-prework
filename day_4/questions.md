## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?


  A function is an action command. We set the function to either retrieve, change, or check on the object's data. We are telling it what to do with our object. I like to think of anytime we need to make a action change, it is a function.

2. What is a parameter?

  The parameter is what we are naming our function, as well as what we are instructing it to do. We take the arguments and put them within our parameter to perform the function.
  The parameter name usually gives a brief description of what we are trying to achieve.

3. What is a return value?

The return value is our results from our function being performed. For instance if we want to find out our available capacity at a restaurant. We might run a function where the parameters are to subtract the current capacity from total capacity. The available capacity would be our return value from that function being performed.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.


function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
};


5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.


var name = Ismail

function helloSomeone() {
  console.log(name + "I am");
}

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

helloSomeone();

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

none.
