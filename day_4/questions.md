## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

The purpose of a function is to add actions to your code that you can use multiple times.

2. What is a parameter?

A parameter is values a function needs to run.
Some functions don't need to use parameters.
Others have default arguments they will use if no parameters are passed.

3. What is a return value?

A return value is the value the function returns to the program. Must use return keyword. Functions by default return undefined.

4. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
function hello (){
  console.log('Sam I am')
}
```

5. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```
function hello_someone (name){
  console.log(name + " " + 'I am')
}
```
6. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?

You have to call the function by writing the function with parentheses and putting the argument you want to call in the function.

 `hello_someone('Taylor')`

7. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
