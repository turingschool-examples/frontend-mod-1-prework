2. What is a parameter?

-The parameters of a function are the input values being used in the function.

3. What is a return value?  

-The return value is the value returned by executing a function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.  

`function hello(){
  console.log("Sam I am");
};`

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.  

`function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
  }`

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?  

`helloSomeone("Jeff");`
