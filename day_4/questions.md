## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
The purpose of a function is to perform  certain task based on a group of statements and possibly parameters. You can use a function to
do a mathematical equation for example, such as computing area or volume by using height width and length parameters.

2. What is a parameter?
Parameters are similar to variables. They are used when a function requires specific information to perform a task or return a value.

3. What is a return value?
A return value is the output you receive from calling a function. For example, this could be a boolean true or false return value, or it could be an integer value that was the result of an equation that was executed in the code block that is part of the declared function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function helloMadmartigan() {
  var name = "Madmartigan"
  console.log(name + " I am")
}

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
helloMadmartigan()

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
So far I believe I understand it. I am very intrigued about writing more complex functions that require many statements or can return multiple values.
