## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

The purpose of a function a way of abstracting a task to be performed, ultimately making your code more succinct and easier to read/decipher.  In lieu of explicitly writing out repeatable code in a tedious fashion, those statements can be held in a function's code block.

2. What is a parameter?

A parameter is a placeholder for data.  It acts as a variable of sorts within a function; it can be used to perform a specific tasks that requires certain input.

3. What is a return value?

A return value is the response to a called function.  When the function is called, t displays the result of the action that was performed in the function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

`function hello() {
  console.log('Sam I am');
};`

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

`function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + ' I am');
};`

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

`hello();
helloSomeone('Reggie');`

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

None at the moment, but I'm sure I will as we continue deeper into the curriculum.
