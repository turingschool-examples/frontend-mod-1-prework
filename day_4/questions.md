## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

A function uses a set of statements to perform a task or calculate a value. The same function can be called (run) as many times as you want within the JavaScript file.

2. What is a parameter?

A parameter is information a function may need to perform its task. Parameters are indicated within the parentheses after the function name.

3. What is a return value?

A return value (statement) is used to return a value out of a function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

```JavaScript
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
}
```

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

```JavaScript
function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am");
}
```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?

```JavaScript
helloSomeone("Sam");
```

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?

Not a question, just feeling like I want to keep practicing this. To start, I feel like I have a good idea of declaring and calling functions, and using parameters.
