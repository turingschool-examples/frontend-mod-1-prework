## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?  

- A function is a useful way to create a reusable code block that can be called in different contexts.

2. What is a parameter?

- The parameters of a function are the input values being used in the function.

3. What is a return value?  

- The return value is the value returned by executing a function.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.  

`function hello(){
  console.log("Sam I am");
};`

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.  

`function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
  }`

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?  

`helloSomeone("Jeff");`

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?  

- No singular pressing questions, moreso just the need to memorize which functions will mutate the caller.
