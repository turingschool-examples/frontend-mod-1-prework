  <h1>Exploring My Passions in Mental Health
  </h1>

  <h2>Collin Kallery</h2>
  <div class="intro">
    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">E</span>ver since I was young, I had always been very interested in helping others, working with kids, and understanding the mind. I have always felt that compassion is one of my greatest strengths, along with one of the
      greatest strengths of humankind as a whole. Compassion brings us all onto the same level - it allows us to remove ourselves from our own individual experience for a few brief moments in an attempt to further understand someone's current state. Compassion
      is one of the most important ingredients in therapeutic settings as well - when a client is struggling and feels as if the entire world is crashing down on him or her, having a trained professional connect with him or her and validate their feelings
      is one of the first major steps in helping that person. Compassion unites us, and throughout my years I have worked hard to dedicate my life to it. As I move forward into the world of coding and technology, I hope to employ compassionate, therapeutic
      values into my daily work.
