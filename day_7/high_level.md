<h1> Checker Board Explanation </h1>

I tried to make this as simple as possible. First we will start off
with programming 2 loops. The first loop counts the numbers of columns and the
second one repeats "#" 4 times per column, inside it. 4"#" and 4" " per row and
column. The distance with "# " is the distance between the character "#" each
other. While the number of the column is odd the distance will be before "#" .
The variable "chr" is to save these repeats inside it to each column.
