To create the ceasar cipher you would begin by making function that would create the cipher. The function would take a parameter of a string that you want to cipher. You would then find the length of that string. You then would loop through the length of the string and change each of the values of the string up 2 in the alphabet. You would do this by having an array that has moved all of the values to the alphabet to the proper index of the array depending on the cipher so X would be in the first index. First to do this though would need to check what the value of the current letter is by running it through another array that has the alphabet in the normal order. Then subtract from the found index unless its at 0 -2 in the index then it would shift to the proper index. Once it has ran through the length of the string it would return the new saved string. When the function is called it would have a return value that would be saved.
