# Checker board

## Steps to create the Checker Board based on user input for user-defined board size.


1. Declare a variable named checkerBoard. This will contain an empty string.

2. Declare a variable called height that contains the number of rows on the checkerboard.

3. Declare a variable called width that contains the number of columns on the checkerboard.

4. The values of height and width can be customized by the user to generate a specific sized board.

5. Next, write a nested loop. The first if statement will add the linebreaks using \n based on the height variable. Then, nested below will be an if/else statement based on width and height and what to print in each spot, either an X or an empty space.

6. Log the variable checkerBoard to the console.
