High Level Explanation of how to solve the ceasar_cipher:


We need to create an object with keys and value pairs to make the cipher work.
The key would be the string and the value would be the number.  


//We would also need an array for alphabet//
var alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')

//we would also need to loop to iterate through the array to give us the output of the cipher.//
for (var i = 0; i <sting.length; i++){

}
function caesar_cipher(str, num) {  
}

Man... i've thought about this for nearly three hours and i'm hitting a wall.
If i were to continue trying to solve this, I would continue to use google as a
resource. But I'm running out of time so I'm going to upload what I have for now...
