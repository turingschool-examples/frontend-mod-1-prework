To create a Caesar Cypher we'd create a class called `CaesarCipher` with a function which receives the user's phrase and their shift value. This will allow us to assign and work with variables from a the function which will transform the user's input. The function within that class will use an array of the alphabet (we'll call it `var plainAlphabet`) and a new array of the alphabet's cipher (`cipherAlphabet`) to translate their input into a new phrase.

To create the `cipherAlphabet`, we'll take a slice from the end of the `plainAlphabet` based on the shift value provided by the user and concat that with a slice of the beginning of the Alphabet. Let's say they want to shift their cipher by 5 characters: `var cipherAlphaBeginning = plainAlphabet.slice(26 - x, 26); var cipherAlphaEnd = plainAlphabet.slice(0, 26 - x);` where x is 5. Now we can create a cipher alphabet by concatenating these slices (`var cipherAlphabet = cipherAlphaBeginning.concat(cipherAlphaEnd)`).  

Objects of the `CaesarCipher` class will also have variables which change the user's phrase into all capital letters (`toUpperCase()`) and then `split()` that phrase into an array. This way we can compare the user's phrase against both the alphabet array, and the cipher array without worrying about the difference between capital and lowercase letters.

Using `plainAlphabet.indexOf(i)` in a `for` loop that runs for the length of the user's phrase, I'll be able to compare values of the user's phrase from an array against the original alphabet. This will provide a number value for each letter which I can assign to a variable (`y`) and use as an index on the cipher (`cipherAlphabet[y]`). As we receive those new letter values, we'll be able to plug them into a new array using `unshift()`, and then `join()` that array into an encoded printable phrase.  These steps would be built into a method of the CaesarCipher class, which we can call `encode()`.
