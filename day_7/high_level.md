1. I would create my variables of strings and integers that I would use to describe the row of the checkerboard.

2. I would then create an Array that would take into account a changing amount while still logging the total number of integers.

3. I would then create two functions that would recognize when the integer pulled from the array is divisible by two and when it is not, so it would print the corresponding string variable and repeat it based off the integer variable defining how large the board is.

4. I would then loop through the array and use an if-else statement to determine which function will be used and thereby printing the resulting checkerboard.
