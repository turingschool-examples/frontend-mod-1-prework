# Checker board

1. First, create a variable for the board, and for    the baord size.

1. Then, create an iteration that will populate the board with the proper number of columns based on the value of the board size variable.

1. Create another iteration that will repeat that iteration an amount of times based on the value of the board size variable. These will be the rows.

1. To determine which character is going in which space, determine if the sum of the first iteration and second iteration is even. If `true`, populate the value with `'X'`, otherwise populate it with `' '`.

1. To organize the board in the proper orientation, each instance of the second iteration will jump to a new line in the string to create the rows.

1. Log the board.
