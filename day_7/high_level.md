### Ceasar Cipher

1. The goal is to get letters of the English alphabet to shift over by a given integer.

1. My first plan:

    * I think I can do it by using .pop to remove letters at the end of the alphabet.

    * Then I could use .unshift to add those same letters to the beginning.

        + Would the alphabet be an array? I think so.

    * I will also need a loop using `for`

    * I am not yet certain how I would apply the shift value.

        + I can imagine updating the .pop to change the shift value.

        + But perhaps it would be best to use a .slice? I am fairly certain that with a slice, I can allow the user the designate the shift value for their string.


1. I am guessing there is a way to shuffle and array, without using .pop or .unshift

    * I think this approach would be simpler. I have done a little research on shuffling, but it seems to contain code that I don't yet understand. I think this another thing I want to come back to and research more.

1. Looking forward to coming back to this and trying out these ideas. And hopefully other ideas as well!  I have a page in my notebook for Capstone day_#s to come back to!
