##Ceasar cipher

* Baised on how the interaction pattern might look, I would create a class called CeasarCipher with an object constructor.

* Write a function called encode to take in a string value and shift value.

* Bring the string variable to all uppercase letters.

* Add variable for alphabet.

* For loop to iterate through alphabet.

* An if statement to find where the letters from the string are in alphabet.

* Use the number range of the alphabet (0 - 26) to create conditional statements.

* Evaluate with if, else if, and else statements in addition to providing parameters for letter shift.

* call the function with:
```javascript
var cipher = new CeasarCipher();
cipher.encode("Hello World", 5);
```
