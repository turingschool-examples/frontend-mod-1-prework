# checker_board

* Take value inputed and make it run in a `for` loop the amount of times asked of it *(let's say 6)*
* Repeat `X ` the indicated 6 times
* Send program to next line, but instead input ` X` 6 times
* Alternate between these two until the limit is hit (which is still 6 times)
*This can be acheived by using odd and even `i` values to alternate what input is used for what line*
*Use `%` operator in order to signify odd or even numbers*
* Output to a string

I have created a `checker_board.js` file with my attempt at this!
