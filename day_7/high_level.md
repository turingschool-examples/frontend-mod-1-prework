1. First, I want to establish some variables. The two variables I want to establish are the `var size = 8` to determine the size of the board indicated by the user and a `var board = " "`  string to indicate what and where characters will be placed according to the program.


2. I then want to create an outerloop to loop through variables for the rows of the checkerboard and also an innerloop to loop through variables for columns.


3. After that, I need to create an if/else statement declare when a column is even, it should print `" "` otherwise, if the column is odd it should print `"X"`.


4. Lastly, I want to add something that will make sure there is a line break after each row.
