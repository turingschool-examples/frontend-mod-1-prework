To begin the coding the Ceasar cipher you must begin with a function. so function ceasarCipher. Since we are using the alphabet and trying to assign all the letters new numbers we our function will have an array of all the letters in the alphabet. We can assign that to var alphabet = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]. Next we will want a loop that works through all the letters of the alphabet. for(var i = 0; i > 26; i++). We want to specify the letter we will be working on var currentLetter = alphabet[i]. We need to know where the letter we are working with is so var currentPosition = alphabet.indexOf(currentLetter). Next we want to move the letter so we would say newPosition = currentPosition + 3. This will shift the letter 3 positions.
