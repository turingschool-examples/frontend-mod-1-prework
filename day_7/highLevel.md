I found a method that is pretty simple. All that is required is that you create a loop that counts up to an even number with an if else function that is just as long. The "if" part has to be set at "i % 2 === 0" and start with "X"'s at every other space and the "X"'s have to alternate on the "else" part.

I made mine count up to six so it looks more even
