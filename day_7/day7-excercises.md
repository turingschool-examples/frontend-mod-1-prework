1. Psychology
Are you assuming they know something that they havenâ€™t learned yet?

Bad: http://www.integris-partners.com
-The first example is a more informative page and walk users through from the first steps. It takes the time to explain the subject and does not assume that you know more than you do. The second page does not give veyr much information, making it harder to understand what they even do.

2. Usability
Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
Good:https://www.airbnb.com
Bad: https://www.colorcodepicker.com
The second site is very confusing as soon as it uploads. It does not give clear instructions and leaves the user scrolling through trying to figure out what is going on.

3. Design
Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?

Bad:https://www.arapahoefloral.com/
While this may just be my personal feelings I don't believe the second site has a very good design. Its not very visually appealing and has a lot of things to scroll through. The first site is very well done and represents the brand very well.

4. Copywriting
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

Bad:https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KC/pages/1269825578/8.9.0+Supported+Code+Languages+and+Frameworks
The first site is very clear and to the point where the second one is kind of a jumbled and confusing mess.

5. Analysis
Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
Good:https://htmlcolorcodes.com
Bad: https://imagecolorpicker.com/
The first site demonstrates that they understand what their users use color codes for. They have the selector front and center so designers can easily access it. The second complicates the situation with unnecessary steps.
