## Day 7 Exercise

### Psychology
#### 1. What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place?
**Good Example:**  
https://www.tesla.com/  
The main motivation for a user that goes to tesla.com is buy a car, solar panels or Tesla Accessories. Tesla does a good job at providing the users a quick and easy way to find what they want. First the main nav at the top has a navigation bar allowing quick acess to any section of the site. The hamburger menu gives an even deeper look. Next there are 4 main scroll sections of the website. The first is about the cars, the second is about the solar panels, the third is about the accessories, and the fourth is order a Model Y.

**Bad Example:**  
https://denver.craigslist.org/  
Craigslist is a bad example of a site that helps or guesses the user motivation. I think it is just all around bad UX. The homepage of a cities craigslist page is a mess with rows and columns for various categories within the website. Each section has a column or two of links within that category. But since it is so much information, it's almost hard to find exactly what you want. I think they should improve their experience by guiding the user through certain flows. For example:  
1. Are you buying or selling?  
  If user is buying  
    1 .1 User clicks buying  
  If user is selling  
      1.1 User clicks Selling  
2. What category  
  2.1 Select or type category  
  2.2 Craigslist display sub categories  
  2.3 User selects of types sub category  
3. What Sub Directory?  
  If User is in Buying  
    3.1 User can scroll through products for sale or search for a product.  
  If User is in selling  
    3.1 User can post an item for sale  

### Usability
#### 2. Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
**Good Example**  
https://bluebottlecoffee.com/at-home  
Blue Bottle Coffee has a very clear process for guiding the user through purchasing a coffee subscription online. There's a little diagram showing how their process works. It includes a graphic for each of the following; Quality, Roasting and Shipping information, and that its your choice of coffee. Below is a filter for choosing the coffee you'd like a subscription to.

Once the user chooses a type of coffee, they are then presented with a visual representation of how many bags will come in their shipment. After selecting the amount of bags, they are given a display of how often they will receive their coffee. I really like how they present the options in a visual way. They guide you effortlessly through this process which can otherwise seem daunting.
