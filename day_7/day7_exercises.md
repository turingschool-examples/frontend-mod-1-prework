1. how much work does the user have to do to get what they want. on google.com they only have to enter their query and hit the search button, very simple, very direct. arngren.net is an overload of everything, where does a person even begin?
2. If the user doesn't read the fine print does the page still work. nfl.com has no obvious fine print and the content is visible and accessible. http://www.monkzone.com/ has a large section of nearly unreadable fine print. I doubt it contains any answers, but i wouldnt know because im not reading it.
3. Does it look good do you trust it immediately? I dont trust https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/best-designed-websites/ Ironic to have a bad website that tries to list good websites. several pop ups block most of the page, one tells me that i must accept the use of their cookies, I dont like it I dont trust it. Im always wary of websites that try to get too much from you too fast.
4. Does it reduce anxiety? https://under.no/ Simple design, muted colors, very chill website for a underwater restaurant. https://www.lingscars.com/ this website is maybe second to argren.net as far as anxiety goes. theres just too much happening. It is kinda funny though.
5. I dont know how to answer this last one. To do analysis i would need data and i dont know how or what to look for. I hope we can go over this later.
