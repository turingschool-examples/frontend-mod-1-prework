## Day 7 Exercise

### 1. Psychology
#### What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place?
**Good Example:**  
https://www.tesla.com/  
The main motivation for a user that goes to tesla.com is buy a car, solar panels or Tesla Accessories. Tesla does a good job at providing the users a quick and easy way to find what they want. First the main nav at the top has a navigation bar allowing quick acess to any section of the site. The hamburger menu gives an even deeper look. Next there are 4 main scroll sections of the website. The first is about the cars, the second is about the solar panels, the third is about the accessories, and the fourth is order a Model Y.

**Bad Example:**  
https://denver.craigslist.org/  
Craigslist is a bad example of a site that helps or guesses the user motivation. I think it is just all around bad UX. The homepage of a cities craigslist page is a mess with rows and columns for various categories within the website. Each section has a column or two of links within that category. But since it is so much information, it's almost hard to find exactly what you want. I think they should improve their experience by guiding the user through certain flows. For example:  
1. Are you buying or selling?  
  If user is buying  
    1 .1 User clicks buying  
  If user is selling  
      1.1 User clicks Selling  
2. What category  
  2.1 Select or type category  
  2.2 Craigslist display sub categories  
  2.3 User selects of types sub category  
3. What Sub Directory?  
  If User is in Buying  
    3.1 User can scroll through products for sale or search for a product.  
  If User is in selling  
    3.1 User can post an item for sale  

### 2. Usability
#### Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
**Good Example:**  
https://bluebottlecoffee.com/at-home  
Blue Bottle Coffee has a very clear process for guiding the user through purchasing a coffee subscription online. There's a little diagram showing how their process works. It includes a graphic for each of the following; Quality, Roasting and Shipping information, and that its your choice of coffee. Below is a filter for choosing the coffee you'd like a subscription to.

Once the user chooses a type of coffee, they are then presented with a visual representation of how many bags will come in their shipment. After selecting the amount of bags, they are given a display of how often they will receive their coffee. I really like how they present the options in a visual way. They guide you effortlessly through this process which can otherwise seem daunting.

**Bad Example:**  
https://www.art.yale.edu/  
This example offers bad usability. It is a repeating animated gif as the background which is very distracting. Each section also has brightly colored or gradients backgrounds which make it difficult to read.

### 3. Design  
#### Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?  
**Good Example:**  
https://envylabs.com/what-we-do/  
Envy does a great job of making it clear what the user should do, as well as guessing at what the user might want to see on this specific page. On the what we do page, they make it very clear that their capabilities are the most important. Next they offer a quote from a client. Then they break down their main services. Each section that the user should be guided to, offers hover effects to indicate they can click to learn more. They finally end the page with the contact form.

**Bad Example:**  
https://denver.craigslist.org/  
I'm going to throw craigslist back in here. Awful design with bad usability.

### 4. Copywriting  
#### Does it reduce anxiety?  

**Good Example:**  
https://bluebottlecoffee.com/at-home  
Also going to use Blue Bottle here. They break down the problem of selecting a coffee, quantity, and delivery frequency into a simple process that allows you to get through it with barely even having to read.

**Bad Example:**  
https://www.art.yale.edu/  
This website gives you anxiety as soon as you hit the page. There are animated gifs, and different colored backgrounds behind text. It gave me a headache the second I landed on the site!

### 5. Analysis
#### Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?  

**Good Example:**  
https://www.myflowater.com/about-us/  
MyFlowater uses a counter to display the amount plastic water bottles they have saved to date. This is a cool feature to show. Not sure how they are collecting this data, but I think its nice to see if you are looking to purchase a filter.

**Bad Example:**  
https://www.myflowater.com/about-us/  
I will use the same example here. While this is fun information to see, they way it has been done is very busy. They should remove the background text and let the user focus on the actual numbers.
