# Day 7: JavaScript

# Chapter 7 (book two)

# 1. There is a great series of UI/UX posts called UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals. Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
**Answer:** <br>
UX or user experience is the concept of creating something that gives pleasure, is easy to use, and overall it works well. This is based on science more than artistic abilities. It's finding ways to improve a website by making hypotheses about how changing details will work better, not about what the designer thinks looks good.
<br>
<br>
User goals are to accomplish a task, it's why they choose to use your site. Business goals are usually to make money, but it could also be to spread brand awareness, get new customers, or do something else.
<br>
1. Psychology: Understanding how your website makes the user feel overall, and making sure they understand and want to continue use.
2. Usability: Finding ways to make it easier/less effort for the user.
3. Design: Making sure users think it looks good, they trust it, and they understand it.
4. Copywriting: Accomplishing tasks as simply and directly as possible with little or no anxiety.
5. Analysis: Finding evidence for your decisions and being intentional.


# 2. After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

**Psychology Q:** Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?<br>
**+ Example:** http://www.facebook.com (This website allows me to communicate with friends. One way of doing this is by leaving messages or comments. I want to visit the website very often so that I may continue conversations with my friends.)<br>
**- Example** https://www.colorado.gov/dmv (I visited this site with the intention of renewing my car registration. It took me approximately 10mins to find the place on this site to do so. The layout is confusing and it does not make me want to use it ever again.)<br>

**Usability Q:** Could you get the job done with less input from the user?<br>
**+ Example:** https://htmlcolorcodes.com (The user can locate a color hex code with minimal effort and without leaving the home page.)<br>
**- Example** https://coolors.co (To find the color hex code you're looking for, you have to go through multiple pages and clicks.)<br>

**Design Q:** Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?<br>
**+ Example:** https://www.generationwild.com (This website looks attractive and professional, it appears to be trustworthy.)<br>
**- Example** https://www.craigslist.org (In a world of pretty and colorful websites, this looks boring and outdated. Seems low budget.)<br>

**Copywriting Q:** Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?<br>
**+ Example:** http://www.the-house.com (This is an outdoor gear website that is simple, clear, and easy to navigate even with selling thousands of diff kinds of products.)<br>
**- Example** https://www.mandg.com (This is an investment website without a clear link on the home page to show the user how to start investing with their company.)<br>

**Analysis Q:** Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?<br>
**+ Example:** http://www.wikipedia.org (The user can typically trust the information on this website is factual because there is a cited resources section showing where each piece of information came from.)<br>
**- Example** http://www.yelp.com (It is unclear if this website is looking for opinions or facts because they allow users to leave either and refuse to step in if the user is leaving incorrect information or subjective opinions.)<br>
