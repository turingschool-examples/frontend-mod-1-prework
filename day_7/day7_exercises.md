### Psychology
Focusing on the question “How does this make them feel?”

Good- https://www.aspca.org/
ASPCA is a great website that pulls on your heart strings and makes you feel sorrow, in turn helping the business with donations.
Bad- https://www.tmz.com/
I think TMZ is a terrible site for user psychology, because it’s either super misleading and full of crap click-bait, or it’s about people spending millions of millions of dollars that most people only wish they could have. Either way, I think the psychology of this website is very negative.

### Usability
Focusing on the question “Is it easy to find, hard to miss, or subconsciously expected?”
Good- https://www.w3schools.com/
I think for web developers, w3schools is the easiest to find website. It’s always a top google result, and the information they give you (not saying it’s always right) is always very easy to find and understand.
Bad- https://www.denverpost.com/
I find the usability of this website to be so frustrating. When you are looking up local news stories, Denver Post is always a top-3 result, yet after 2 or 3 reads of their articles, they say you need to subscribe and pay monthly to keep reading. I understand the business aspect of this, but the stories they post are no different than other local news, so I just know to read from somewhere like 9news, which means less foot traffic for Denver Post.

### Design
Focusing on the question “Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?”
Good- https://www.apple.com/
I think the way Apple sets up it’s webpages is perfect. From scrolling effects to easy-to-read menu bars and good font contrast, they nail every aspect.
Bad- http://www.roverp6cars.com/
This webpage is just a mess overall. Buttons are hard to read, there’s too much going on at once. Not a good example.

### Copywriting
Focusing on the question “Does is sound confident and tell the user what to do?”
Good- https://velocitypartners.com/
Big bold letters stating “great marketing moves” followed by the very bottom of the page that says “opt into our crap” you can tell they are confident with what they do.
Bad- http://cloud9walkers.com/
The description of links, the size of font and locations of the text… this does not seem like a professional page, doesn’t seem like they are confident with what they do.

### Analysis
Focusing on the question “Are you looking for bad results too?”
Good- https://www.dhmo.org/truth/Dihydrogen-Monoxide.html
This website is literally made to tell you water will kill you…. They definitely took the time to look at the bad results.
Bad- https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/example-of-media-bias/cnn-interviews-presidential-candidate-bernie-sanders-ignores-mass-protests-in-venezuela/
This was harder to find, but political bias websites are huge and one sided, typically leaving out all of the bad results and feeding people only what they want to share.
