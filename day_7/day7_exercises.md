<p><b> Psychology : How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?</p></b>

Supports: amazon.com  - minimal work, type the search in the search box and hundreds of options available immediately.
<p>Violates: https://us.boohoo.com/womens/new-in?prefn1=category&prefv1=Dungarees|Jumpsuits - way too much work to filter down to the variety of items I want. Have to click each category individually, site refreshed after each click and doesn't bring you back to where you where in the list, so you have to scroll back to your position each time. </p>

<p><b> Usability : Could you get the job done with less input from the user?</p></b>

Supports: https://www.lemonade.com/ - to sign up, takes less than 5 minutes and only uses the exact amount of info/input necessary to get set up.
<p> Violates: www.buzzfeed.com - wants to encourage commenting to engage on articles but makes you sign in or register in order to comment, which shouldn't be necessary if commenting can be anonymous anyway.

<p><b> Design : Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know? </p></b>

Supports: https://www.netflix.com/browse - The design is heavily focused on shows and movies that are already tailor made for the user. It also makes the search/my list/general categories clear at the top.
<p> Violates: https://www.art.yale.edu/ - I have no clue where this is supposed to lead me, but with the animated GIFs tiled in the background and excessive other animation/color/contrasting text and background colors, there is no clear direction where my eyes are supposed to go. </p>

<p><b> Copywriting : Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional? </p></b>

Supports: https://www.airbnb.com/ - clearly asks what you are looking for, allows search, simple filtering, functional and easy to immediately book.
<p> Violates: https://www.uat.edu/ - main homepage has clickable icons for different programs or areas on the page, but they are swirling around and make it extraordinarily difficult to find what you need or even know what will be on those pages once you click on them. </p>


<p><b> Analysis : Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts? </p></b>

Supports: https://www.youtube.com/ - before many videos, poses survey questions about what the user has objectively experienced with option buttons - doesn't ask for subjective feedback about how they are liking the site or video.
<p> Violates: https://www.ulta.com/ - sends out emails after purchases asking how you enjoyed the experience, with a comment box. This opens up for subjective opinions without much objectivity from the user. </p>
