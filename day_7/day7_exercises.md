# Capstone Day 7

## Good and Bad UI/UX Examples:

1. **Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?**

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/): Youtube is a great example of a website that promotes ease of access to the user. Not only does your homepage immediately display videos from content creators you've watched previously, but as you click on videos the algorithm will continue to suggest related content.

- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com): Glassdoor is a bit confusing to navigate and often times shows the user advertised jobs that are nowhere near the searched address.



2. **Usability: If the user doesnâ€™t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?**

- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com): Netflix is about as intuitive as it gets, showing easy to follow menus and little text.

- [Github](https://www.github.com): While Github is by no means a bad website, an inexperienced user woud most likely not be able make out the majority of what they are seeing without "reading the fine print."



3. **Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?**

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com): Amazon might not be the most appealing website in the world, but it immediately conveys its purpose and which brand it belongs to, establishing the user's trust.

- [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.com): Craigslist has an extremely minimal and boring design, which may make it appear unprofessional or even sketchy to a prospective user.

4. **Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?**

- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com): Instagram keeps their copywriting simple, only using text where absolutely necessary. This approach makes the website easy for anyone to use, as their is minimal reading involved.

- [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b?ie=UTF8&node=2676882011): Amazon prime video is cluttered and text heavy, unlike similar streaming services. This makes the page unappealing and slightly confusing to the eye.

5. **Analysis: Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?**

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com): Facebook often asks users to complete user surveys on what could be improved about the site, as well as hosting a forum for users to submit questions and complaints about the website such as usability.

- [Walmart](htttps://www.walmart.com): Walmart and other brand websites don't normally have forms to submit feedback, or at least they don't make their existence obvious.
