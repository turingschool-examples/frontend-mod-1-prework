1. Psychology:

How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

``supports: https://www.amazon.com/ - clearly layed out. search function at the very top of your page to find what ypou need.
  doesn't support: https://dojmt.gov/driving/ - Montana DMV no clearly visible search function, too busy.``


2. Usability:

Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?

``supports: https://www.apple.com/: very minimalist design, easy to take everything in, not crowded,m direct.
does not support: https://www.phila.gov/departments/philadelphia-parks-recreation/: philadelphia parks and rec website. There is too  much on the home page making it a little too much to look at. needs to be simpler``

3. Design

Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

``supports: https://www.airbnb.com/- looks nice, a lot of information on home page but all very well designed and laid out simply. I trust it.
does not support: https://patriotgetaways.com/- looks outdated and badly designed. top of page too busy.``

4. Copywrighting

Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

``supports: https://www.skyscanner.com/ - all text is clear, simple, well contained.
does not support: https://www.maine.gov/ifw/hunting-trapping/licenses-permits/hunting-license.html - way too much text on one page. makes finding what you are looking for hard``

5. Analysis

Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

``supports: https://slack.com/ - great intro page, clearly invested in user feedback, well designed, simple, sophisticated
does not support:
does not support: https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=kayak+rental&find_loc=Philadelphia%2C+PA - I personally find yelp to be an ugly, busy annoying to navigate website``
