Supports: [Rover](https://www.rover.com/)<br/>
Rover is a dog sitting company. What Rover understands about its users is how important trust is. They do a good job building users trust through online reviews and photo updates while you're gone.

Violates: [Roomies.com](https://www.roomies.com/)<br/>
Roomies.com helps people find random roommates. The site has no reviews or testimonies from previously successful roomie finds.

Violates: [ARNGREN.NET](https://websitesfromhell.net/view/arngren.net-8/)<br/>
This site is so unlclear that I don't know exactly its purpose. I think it sells electronics?


### 3. Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know?

Supports: [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home)<br/>
The design here is simple which makes it effective. The page is well organized and the context is clear.

Violates: [Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.](http://www.pnwx.com/)<br/>
This web design is like a mixed color palette, which contains plenty conflicting colors and text colors, and also mixed with the background color. All those make it difficult for users to read at all. Also, the navigation is quite complicated.

### 4. Does it reduce anxiety?

Supports: [Simple](https://www.simple.com)<br/>
The site adds clarity and digestibility to finance. One feature on their site is the Safe to Spend amount, which is calculated based on your available balance minus your bills and savings goals.

Violates: [ANGREN.NET](https://websitesfromhell.net/view/arngren.net-8/)<br/>
I'm using this web page again because the design is _that_ bad. Anxiety is the first emotion I feel when visiting the page.

### 5. Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?

Supports: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)<br/>
Apple is constantly running tests on their products and taking user surveys and opinions to improve their branding. One obvious tell-all that this is a great design experience is that they are one of the most popular electronics company partially because the consistent design across all of their products.

Violates: [Rudgwick Steam & Country Show](http://www.rudgwicksteamshow.co.uk)<br/>
This site does not sell the user on attending one of their shows. It is random and lacks a clear picture. A lot of meaningless graphics.
