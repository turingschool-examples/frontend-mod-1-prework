    <h2>About the Stegosaurus</h2>
    <h3>What is a Stegosaurus?</h3>
    <p>Well, that is not an entirely straight forward question. At the surface a Stegosaurus is a herbivorous dinosaur dating to the late Jurassic period. They are recognizable by the rows of plates on their back and down their long tail. It is however an understatement to say that the Stego is just another dinosaur. The Stegosaurus is by far the <strong>most awesome</strong> of all the dinosaurs and some would go as far as saying it is the <u>best animal ever</u>. I for one, am included in that "some."</p>
    <h3>What does the Stegosaurus look like?</h3>
    <p>While we have a pretty good idea what the Stegos looked like based on fossil evidence, no one truly knows what colors they were. Most scientists familiar with the Stegosaurus would argue they were a greenish, grayish mix of colors, similar to reptiles today. Could it be possible that the Stegos were actually bright, flourescent colors? Or, maybe they changed colors like the chameleon. Maybe, they were rainbow colored???</p>

    <h2>Why are Stegos so Cool?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>They had 17 plates on their back.</li>
      <li>Their tail spikes averaged 2-3 feet in length!</li>
      <li>Yea...their tail spikes could be up to 3 feet long!!!</li>
      <li>They could be 30 feet long and 14 feet tall!</li>
      <li>They were peace-loving and got along with all the other dinosaurs.</li>
      <li>The State Dinosaur of Colorado is the Stegosaurus.</li>

    <h2>What's up with Stego-haters?!</h2>
    <p>Anytime you're on top there is going to be envy and it is no different for the Stegosaurus. As the best and most awesome of all the dinosaurs the Stego has its fair share of "haters." Although most of these people don't understand science and are impossible to reason with, their arguments are ill thoughtout and easy to poke holes in.</p>
    <h3>Most Common Anti-Stego Rhetoric</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Stegosaruses are not even the coolest dinosaur, much less animal. The T-Rex is much cooler."</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>The T-Rex is sooooo overrated my friend! Sure they have a huge head and are tall, but who cares. Just because they have a big head doesn't make them that smart. Besides, they have the tiniest hands ever! Think about it...what if your hands were the size of a rat's and your head was the size of a whale's. That doesn't sound like much fun to me.</em></li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>"Stegos have tiny heads and tiny brains therefore they aren't that smart."</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Just because their head is small, does not make them stupid. Dogs have small heads and they're pretty smart. Same with dolphins. Same with monkeys. Think about this...Border Collies are considered one of the smartest, if not the smartest, dogs out there. Their heads are a fraction of the size of a Newfoundlands. In reality, there is no way to know exactly how smart Stegos really were...but I'm guessing they were pretty dang smart.  </em></li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>"Who cares, they're just dinosaurs?"</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Stop. Listen to yourself. That's ignorant. Dinosaurs are the coolest! Haven't you ever seen Jurassic Park?? Or the Land Before Time?? Or the early 1990's ABC tv show, Dinosaurs???<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U4ljtg5vXYQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Not the Mama, Dinosaurs Tv Show" title="Not the Mama, Dinosaurs TV Show"</em></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
