            <p>I'm really not a big sweets person. One year Mimi asked me what type of birthday cake I wanted, without thinking I said mashed potato with brown gravy icing. It's really what I wanted and it's what I got, and it's still the best birthday cake I've ever had. My wife, however, has quite the sweet tooth-- she even saves pie for breakfast. So we had to find some sweets that we could both get down on. We both love these <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25787/coconut-macaroons-iii//">Macaroons</a> from allrecipes.</p>
