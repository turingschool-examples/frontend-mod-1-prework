    <h2>Museo San Telmo</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p><a href="https://www.santelmomuseoa.eus/">This museum</a> is a real gem.
        Carve out a couple hours to learn about the Basque region's rich history
        full of deep rooted traditions. The collections cover Basque history
        through the millenia, from the Middle Ages to more recent events,
        including the Spanish Civil War and the Franco dictatorship.

    <h2>Tabakalara (aka Taba)</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>I adore this place. <a href="https://www.tabakalera.eu/">Taba</a> is a
        cultural center that features rotating exhibits, workshops, concerts and
        a really nice, bustling cafe with great coffee, beer and wine. Plus you
        can catch a conversation exchange if you want to practice some Spanish!
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Monte Urgull & La Concha</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>This is a beautiful little hike with great views of the famous, La
        Concha. At the summit, you will find the Castillo de la Mota, which
        served as a defense since the early ages of the city, and the large
        statue of Jesus. If you are there during the warmer, drier months, you
        will find a little bar with stellar views, olives and craft beer at the
        top. Afterwards, stroll along the bay of La Concha for the quintessential
        views of the city.

    <h2>Surf at Zurriola Beach</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>Rent a board at <a href="https://pukassurf.com/">Puka’s Surf Shop</a>
        at Zurriola beach and discover a great break with a stunning view. You
        can also take a class at Puka's or at the <a href="http://zurriolasurfeskola.com/en/">
        Zurriola Surf School</a>. The lineup can get pretty busy but if you
        observe beforehand there is a sandbar where beginners usually congregate.

    <h2>Pintxo Tour</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>Hit the streets of old town and try an assortment of pinxtos. You'll
        see bars around every corner with bars full of eye-catching pinxtos.
        Basically, they are finger foods sometimes served on slice of bread and
        piled high with fresh seafood, sausage, goat cheese—you name it. You
        can chase them down with a glass of Txakoli, sidra (Basque cider), a
        caña or whatever else you fancy. Check out <a href=
        "https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/the-top-10-pintxo-bars-in-san-sebastian-spain/">

    <h2>Hike to Pasaia</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>San Sebastían is a stop along a route of the Camino de Santiago, so
        there are beautiful hiking trails along the coast. This is a gorgeous,
        easy to moderate hike (just shy of 5 miles) that takes you to Pasaia,
        which is home to <a href="http://www.albaola.com/en">Albaola Itsas Kultur
        Faktoria</a>, a museum showcasing the building of historic wooden ships.
        Pasaia was the main whaling port in Europe. Be sure to walk through the
        nearby villages and/or take a ferry across the river for lunch.

    <h2>Hike to Zarautz</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>This hike along the Camino del Norte is roughly 14 miles (from San
        Sebastián) and passes through Orio, a beautiful town worth exploring. The
        trail passes through rural farmland and has stunning views of the coast.
        Before taking the train back to San Sebastián, stroll along the beach
        in Zarautz and walk through the old town to get a feel for the city.

    <h2>Visit a Basque Cider House</h2>
    <div class="itinerary">
      <p>This will hands down be your coolest dining experience in the Basque
        country, but the window is rather small. The official start of the cider
        season is middle of January and runs until April or May. They serve set
        orders of chorizo, tortilla de bacalao, bacalao con pimientos, a huge
        steak and for dessert, cheese with fruit paste and almonds. Making this
        a truly unique experience, is drinking the cider (or sidra) straight
        from the giant barrels. Everyone congregates around the barrels drinking
        fresh Basque cider, which is not sweet like most other ciders. You return
        to your table and eat. Then repeat all over again! When the tap of a new
        barrel is opened, you'll hear a loud shout of “txotx!” Read more on this
        Basque experience

    <h2>Pro Tip: learn some Basque</h2>
      <p>The Basque people speak Basque, or Euskara, in addition to Castilian
        Spanish. If you're traveling in this region, it’s a good idea to learn a
        few key word or phrases. There is a strong sense of pride that comes
        with the Basque language, probably because they had to fight for its
        survival over the years (and wars). It predates the romantic languages
        and is a language isolate that bears no relations with any other
        language. The language is spoken in Southwestern France and Northwestern
        Spain.</p>
