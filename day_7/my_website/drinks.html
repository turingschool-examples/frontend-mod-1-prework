          <h2 id="eggnog">Christmas Spiced Eggnog</h2>
          <img src="img/drinks/eggnog.jpg" alt="spiced eggnog" width="600">
          <div class="recipe_intro">
            <p>I love eggnog. True, it's heavy and rich, but I am thrilled when the holidays roll around and that festively decorated carton shows up in the milk aisle. I cannot stop myself from picking up a jug, as well as the ice cream, and swapping out the milk in my scone recipe with it. Like I said, I love it. As a kid I tried making my own to make up for the eggnog drought that existed January through October, Mimi would sit in the kitchen and watch me barely blend egg yolks sugar and milk with a hand mixer, pour it into wine glasses, and serve her what I thought to be a product comperable to that sold in grocery stores. Being the saint that she is she'd take a tiny sip, swallow hard and with a faint smile tell me "it's okay". I think we all know it wasn't okay. In fact, I'd say it was probably really bad. As I've gotten a older and my belly more tender I've learned a few things about maing it myself: use a blender, oat milk isn't all that bad and add spirits. So, if you're looking to escape the holiday maddness or like myself, you just can't get enough, I've found this recipe from <a href="https://jessicainthekitchen.com/boozy-christmas-spiced-eggnog/">Jessica in the Kitchen</a> that really hits the spot.</p>

          <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
              <li>3 large eggs, yolks and whites separated, room temperature</li>
              <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cups any type of milk or cream (I use oat)</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
              <li>Rum or brandy or bourbon</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon all spice</li>
              <li>ground cinnamon, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <ol class="directions">
            <li>Add the separated egg yolks and sugar to a blender and blend until a light creamy colour, about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the milk with the spices and vanilla over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes until steam begins to rise and the surface begins to bubble slightly, constantly stirring. Set aside to cool slightly for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add a little bit of spice milk mixture into the blender and blend to temper the egg, ensure the mixture isn't too hot. Add the rest of the milk mixture and blend to combine.</li>
            <li>Return this mixture to the pan, add the alcohol, stir and heat for about 1 minute on medium heat. The eggnog should be frothy.</li>
            <li>Serve warm in small glasses with some or cinnamon freshly grated on top. Add a cinnamon stick for garnish if you wish.</li>

          <img src="img/drinks/mulled_wine.jpg" alt="mulled wine" width="600">
          <div class="recipe_intro">
            <p>Nothing (besides eggnog) quite says the holidays or it's cold and I wish my wine were hot quite like Mulled wine. Conceived in the 2nd century, Romans would heat their wine in an attempt to defend their bodies against the cold weather. A recipe can be found in <i>The Forme of Cury</i>, a collection of medieval recipes from the 14th century! As they conquered much of Europe over the next century the delicious beverage spread. Amazingly, the recipe has hardly changed: wine, sugar, and spices combined on a stove top to boil. Truly, it's that easy. See for yourself.

          <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
              <li>1 Bottle of dry red wine </li>
              <li>1 orange sliced into rounds</li>
              <li>8 whole cloves</li>
              <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
              <li>2 star anise</li>
              <li>2-4 tbsp honey (to taste)</li>
              <li>Brandy (optional)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <ol class="directions">
            <li>Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan, and heat just barely to a simmer. Don't boil, it will burn all the alcohol off. Reduce the heat and low simmer for anywhere from 15 min to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Strain and serve warm, garnish with cinnamon sticks or orange slices if you'd like.</li>
