<p> Before buying or making your first fragrance, it can be useful to understand some key terms and concepts. To start, an important clarification is that, in America, there is generally not a chemical difference in products described as <em class="vocab">perfume</em> versus those described as <em class="vocab">cologne</em>. In the American market, cologne and perfume have become gendered words and are assosciated with more "masculine" and "feminine" scents. Despite this marketing, people of all genders can wear whatever fragrance they like. There are no gender police patrolling the perfume counter at Nordstrom, so ignore the marketing and select whatever fragrance you love. </p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p> That being said, there is a specific meaning behind the French terms you see on fragrance bottles. These terms can help you understand the strength and concentration of a fragrance. <em class="vocab"> Parfum (or Extrait De Parfum)</em> is the strongest concentration of perfume oil you can purchase, generally between 15-30%. <em class="vocab"> Eau de Parfums (EDP)</em> have between 15-20% concentration of perfume oils. This is one of the most common formulations for mainstream fragrances. Fragrances marked as <em class="vocab"> Eau de Toilette (EDT)</em> have between 5-15% and are usually lighter scents. Not to be confused with cologne (at least in America), <em class="vocab"> Eau de Cologne </em> has a very light concentration of perfume oils between 2-4%. <em class="vocab"> Eau Fraiche </em> also has a lower concentration of perfume oil (between 1-3%). They differ from eau de cologne in that they have very little alcohol and are mixed with mostly water, meaning they are very light and generally fleeting. For a full explanation of each subtype, see this article from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/smarter-living/differences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html">The New York Times.</a></p>

<p> While the concentration of perfume oils affects how "strong" a fragrance is, there are also two other factors called <em class="vocab">sillage</em> and <em class="vocab">longevity.</em> <em class="vocab">Sillage</em>  refers to how the scent projects once applied (basically if it can be smelled at a distance). Scents with strong sillage diffuse around the room when you enter and can be overwhelming up close. Scents with moderate sillage are good "elevator scents," meaning they can be smelled when in an elevator with the wearer. Scents with weaker sillage usually require being close to the wearer to detect. With sillage, stronger is not always better and many people actually prefer more close-to-body scents with weaker sillage, especially for everyday wear. You can somewhat alter the sillage of a fragrance by applying more or less and layering it with other fragrances or lotions. If you have a strong fragrance that is overwhelming, you can apply a half spray to decrease the sillage slightly. Unscented lotion is a good base that can increase the sillage and longevity of many fragrances. <em class="vocab">Longevity</em> means how long the fragrance lasts once applied. This varies based on fragrance and body chemistry. You can increase the longevity of a lower-performing scent by spraying it onto your clothing (it breaks down less than on the skin). Because of the alcohol and oils, fragrance tends to stain clothing so be sure to test this approach first in an inconspicuous spot.

<br><br><br><br>
<p>A fragrance is usually composed of multiple <em class="vocab">notes.</em> Notes are the individual scents that compose a fragrance. For example, a cologne might have notes of orange, sandalwood, and vetiver. Each of those notes can, in theory, be smelled individually when the fragrance is applied. When composing a fragrance, perfumers create compositions with multiple layers of notes that reveal themselves over time. As perfumers are constantly creating new scents and notes, it is impossible to have a full list. <a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/notes/">This is the most complete list I have found.</a>
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p> <em class="tip"> Pro Tip: </em> Notes can perform differently on different people. For example, I have a perfume that smells like a cool white floral with my body chemistry, but smells exactly like black licorice on my sister. This is why it is important to test out a fragrance before buying if you can. Both Nordstrom and Sephora have a wide variety of fragrances (including some niche fragrances that can be difficult to find) and are liberal with giving out samples. There are also online vendors who sell small decants of fragrances, but be sure to find a reputable vendor or you risk getting a watered down or immitation fragrance. </p>
<br><br><br><br>
<ul>
<li> <em class="vocab">Top Notes</em>
  <br>Top notes are the first impression you get from a fragrance. They will be most pronounced in the bottle and on your skin upon first application. They will eventually fade and reveal more of the middle notes as the perfume dries and breaks down on your skin. Top notes are often citrus or aromatic herbs.</li> <br>
<li> <em class="vocab">Middle Notes</em>
  <br> Middle notes are also called "heart notes" because they compose the heart of the fragrance. They are detectable throughout the majority of the fragrance's performance, often peeking through top notes in the beginning and faintly clinging to base notes towards the end. Notes like jasmine, cinnamon, pepper, pine, and neroli are common middle notes.</li> <br>
<li> <em class="vocab">Base Notes</em>
  <br> Base notes linger on the skin the longest. They tend to be deeper notes, like cedar, musk, vetiver, and leather. </li> <br>
</ul>

<br><br><br><br>
<p> There are also categories used to group fragrances and notes. While there is debate over what constitutes its own olfactory group, the commonly accepted groups are <em class="vocab"> aromatic, chypre, citrus, floral, leather, oreintal, </em> and <em class="vocab"> woody. </em> There is some contention over whether the term "oriental" is insensitive, which it very well may be, but it remains the common descriptor used by perfumers for scents with amber, resins, musks, and spices. Again, <a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/groups/">Fragrantica</a> is the best resource for reading in depth about each of these olfactory groups. </p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p> Within each of these olfactory groups, there are subcategories used by perfumers to categorize fragrances more specifically. As you can see in the image below, these classifications can be highly specific.</p>
