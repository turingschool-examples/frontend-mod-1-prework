            The first recorded baseball contest took place in 1846 where the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23-1, in just four innings. The first World Series was played between Pittsburgh and Boston in 1903 and was a nine-game series. Boston won the series 5-3. The National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum is located in Cooperstown, N.Y. It was created in 1935 to celebrate baseball's 100th anniversary.

            What I love about baseball is how relaxing it is to me. For me, there is nothing better then going to a baseball game and taking in all the sights and sounds. From the Star-Spangled Banner to the sound of the baseball when it hits a bat or mit. Not to mention all the stadium food and drinks in between.
