    <h1>The Various Types of Biking</h1>
    <p class="credits">By: Jeremy Poulter</p><br>
    <p class="intro">According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle">Wikipedia</a>, bikes have been around for a couple of centuries with the first bike being invented in Germany during 1817.  Since then, bikes have evolved over time to better fit the needs of those using them.  A bicycle is a type of vehicle with two tires connected to a frame, in which one of the tires is located in the front of the other.  Bicycles are usually human powered through the act of pedaling but some bikes also have a motor attached to assist with powering its movement.</p>

    <h2>Three Different Types of Biking:</h2>

    <br>

  <h3>Road Biking</h3>

    <p>Road biking as the name implies, is where a bicyclist will bike only on paved paths such as roads or sidewalk trails.  Road biking is commonly associated with the sport of professional bike racing across a long distance such as the Tour de France.  This type of biking is most often done as a form of exercise, as a form of competitive sport, or to cover far distances at fast speeds.  Typically, road biking is the fastest form of biking because it is done on well paved paths using bicycles specifically designed to travel as fast as possible.  <br><br>Looking at the picture above shows what a common road bike looks like.  Road bikes have a much thinner frame and thinner tires than other bikes.  The frame and other materials used on this bike are made out of very light materials but still have sturdy strength to them such as specially formulated titanium alloys.  As you can see, the handle bars curl down towards the end and they seat is located at either the height or above the handle bars.  </p>

  <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>

    <p>Despite the implications of the name, mountain biking doesn't always involve mountains.  Mountain biking simply refers to bicycling that takes place on paths and trails that can consist of more rugged terrain such as rocks, vegetation, dirt, water, etc.  These types of paths can definitely be found on mountains but they can also be found throughout the city.  At the more challenging levels of mountain biking, the trails are often times highly technical and difficult to navigate.  It can take a lot of practice and expertise to even be able to successfully bike along those trails.  <br><br>As you can see in the picture above, mountain bikes have some key differences from road bikes.  Mountain bikes are made out of much heavier and thicker frames, as well as thicker tires that have deep treads on them.  Most mountain bikes have shocks to absorb the bumpiness of rugged roads and those shocks can be located on the front tire, the back of the frame near the back tire, and the seat.  Mountain bikes have gear shifters on both sides of the handle bars to offer a large number of gears for bicyclist to shift through so that they are better equipped to handle the incline and terrain they are on. </p>

    <h3>Biking to Commute</h3>

    <p>Biking to commute is probably the most common form of biking, as bicycles serve as a significant source of transportation in many cities.  This type of biking can be done on streets, sidewalks, or bike-paths. <br><br>While biking to commute can utilize any type of bike to do, some of the more commonly used commuter bikes are a sort of hybrid of road and mountain bikes.  The tires are mid size to allow for adaptation to various paths, the frame is medium size and weight.  There are sometimes a handful of gears that cyclists can shift through.  In general, these bikes are usually much cheaper than the other two types of bikes because it doesn't require as much specialization and can use cost efficient materials while still meeting the needs of its users. </p>
    <h2>My Experience With Biking</h2>

    <p>For me personally, my favorite type of biking is mountain biking.  Mountain biking lets me enjoy nature while also providing me with a challenging workout.  The types of mountain bike trails are so varied that one moment you can be biking down a dirt path and the next you are on a path that consists of small and medium sized rocks or through a forest of trees.  My favorite mountain biking trails are the downhill ones at Winterpark Resort and Breckenridge.  These use the same mountains as the snowboarding/skiing slopes, those resorts change their slopes to mountain bike trails during the summer and you can use the ski lift to get to the top so that a majority of your biking is downhill. The following is a list of some of my favorite places, and each item is clickable link if you'd like to learn more about those trails such as length, location, difficulty, etc.</p>
