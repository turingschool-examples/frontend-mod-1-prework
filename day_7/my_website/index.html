         CYTOKINE MODEL OF DEPRESSION:
         THEORY AND TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS

       <h2>Disclamer:

         <ul>

           <li>Some folks have positive experiences with SSRI’s!</li>
     <li>Important to contextualize depression in terms of trauma and social/structural factors, including experiences of marginalization and depression</li>
           <li>Anti-inflammatory treatments and can be used in conjunction with SSRI’s</li>

         </ul>

         <br>

         <h3>MYTH OF THE “CHEMICAL IMBALANCE”

           <p>
             <img src="https://github.com/oliviacweb/Images/blob/master/pills.jpg?raw=true" alt="pills in hand"><br>The idea that a neurotransmitter imbalance in the brain causes or contributes to depression is widely cited.
     Central in marketing of drugs likes SSRI’s. This theory was first introduced in 1965
     and was not backed by subsequent studies.
     "A serotonin deficiency for depression has not been found" (Glenmullen, 2000, p.197).

         <h3>
           RETHINKING SSRI'S<p>Research on the efficacy of anti-depressants supports the need to reevaluate them as first line treatment for moderate to severe depression. A 2005 review in BMJ concluded: “recent meta-analyses show selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have no clinically meaningful advantage over placebo” (Moncreiff and Kirsch, 2005). A comparison of depression rating scale scores suggests differences the between placebo and antidepressants are clinically insignificant
           There are also notable side effects and withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRI medication </p>

         <h3>
           INFLAMMATORY (‘CYTOKINE’) MODEL OF DEPRESSION<p><img src="https://github.com/oliviacweb/Images/blob/master/inflammation.jpg?raw=true" alt="inflammed body"><br>A theory that pro-inflammatory molecular messengers in the body constitute the main physiological mechanism behind depression emerged in 1985.
     Depression associated with increase in markers of inflammation:<ul>
           <li>increased IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)</li>
           <li>decreased red blood cells</li>
           <li>increased reticulocyte number</li> <li>changes in iron 			metabolism</li>
           <li>increased basal concentration of cortisol</li>
           </ul></p>
     </h3>

       <h3>
         HERBAL & ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS: GREEN TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS)<p><img src="https://github.com/oliviacweb/Images/blob/master/greentea.jpg?raw=true" alt="cup of tea"><br>In a 2017 trial, l-theanine administration over two months was shown to improve depressive symptoms as well as anxiety, impaired sleep, and cognitive issues in patients with major depressive disorder (Hidese et al., 2017).
     Another study looked at older adults in China and found that consistent and frequent tea-drinking was associated with significantly less depressive symptoms (Shen et al, 2019)
