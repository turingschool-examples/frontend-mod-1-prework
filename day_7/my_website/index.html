      <h3> DISCLAIMER </h3>
    </div>
  <p class="disclaimer">
    I want to be very clear here: <b> every single member of the Queer Eye cast is an absolute saint. </b> They each have their own flair they bring to the show. They each have gone through their fair share of struggles and have come out on top every time. And each of them have traits that we can all look up to: JVN's vivaciousness, Karamo's empathy, Tan's sass, Antoni's...t-shirts? However, I think there is one thing that has become painfully obvious through the shows 5 seasons, and that is this:
      <br />
      <span class="bobby"> Bobby Berk, while one of the least popular of the cast, is objectively the best of the crew.</span> Unconvinced? Let's dive in.

  <h3> Some Berk-ground </h3>
      <blockquote class=background> "When I came out, everybody in my life that said they loved me unconditionally turned around and said 'Nevermind!'" - BB </blockquote>
      <p>First of all, it would appear as though Bobby Berk was legitimately born named Bobby, rather than Robert, which is the most Southern/Midwestern thing I've ever heard. Lil' Bobby Berk was adopted and grew up in Missouri in an Amish farm country. Realizing how difficult being gay in the Bible Belt would be, he left home at 15. He was homeless, living out of his car and working double shifts at Applebee's until he moved to Denver, where he got his start in interior design/home furnishings. </p>

  <p>
    After some time with this first company, Bobby decided that interior design was 100% his thing and moved to NYC with $100, which would buy him maybe a ginger shot and a sandwich at a bodega. Without a diploma or any formal education at all, he worked his way to up creative director at a fancy AF home furnishing company. When he decided that wasn't enough, he launched his own online and brick-and-mortar store, <a href= "https://bobbyberk.com/">Bobby Berk Home </a>. 4 years later, our little overachiever then launched an interior design services company. After a few more ventures, he went through the painstaking process of auditioning and being chosen as the design expert for our beloved show, Queer Eye, beating out thousands of other applicants (obviously). </p>

<h3> Bobby Berk: The Hardest-Working Guy in the Room </h3>
  <blockquote class="life"> "Even if you are not ready to live your life at full volume, turn it up half way and get yourself there." - BB.</blockquote>
    <p>
    So those facts are all amazing in their own right and show how dedicated, resilient, strong, etc. etc. Bobby really is. But for those who are uninterested in trivia about him, let's redirect our attention to his persona on Queer Eye. Bobby is the design expert on Queer Eye, where he takes entire homes and redesigns them within a week. In reality, the turnaround is actually a whole redesign in about 4 days since filming as a whole wraps in 7 days. I cannot stress this enough - <b> Bobby Berk redesigns, refurnishes, and sometimes reconstructs, an entire Hero's home within 4 days. </b> Let's quickly compare this work to the rest of the cast.

  <p>
    <ul><li> Tan: buys the Hero new clothes.
    <li> JVN: gives them a haircut and is super encouraging.
    <li> Karamo: sits them down for several heart-to-hearts.
    <li> Antoni: cooks a thing sometimes? Teaches them how to make guac?
      </ul>
  </p>
    <p class="gb"><b> Groundbreaking. </b>
  </p>
<h3> A Visual Tale of Bobby's Superiority </h3>
    <p> Here are some before and after shots of the homes Bobby has reinvented due to his incredible talent and efficiency.<br />
      <br/>

      <p> These couple of shots barely scratch the surface of what Bobby is capable of and has done. As JVN would say:

    </p>
<br />

  <h3> Convinced? </h3>
  <p class="conclusion"> Based on his incredible inner strength to survive and thrive through an unreasonably challenging start in life, paired with his demonstrated talent, work ethic, and efficiency, it is clear that Bobby Berk is without a doubt the best cast member on Queer Eye. Again, this is not meant to discount all the positive characteristics and great work the other cast members do (except maybe Antoni). Sound off below if you have a different, incorrect opinion! </p>
