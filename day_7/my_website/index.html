The idea that two people could compete against one another in a contest of skill and mental fortitude appealed to me far more than the typical platformers seen on the console at the time.</p>

While I no longer seek to make a career of it, the love for the competition of fighting games has never faded and has allowed me to compete at the highest levels in the largest tournaments in North America.</p>
