  <h1>Gratitude</h1>

  <h2>What it does for our minds.</h2>
  <p>A simple google search on gratitude reveals there are a large number of studies done on the benefits of gratitude on our mental well-being:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">Giving thanks can make you happier (Harvard)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-anger/201807/science-proves-gratitude-is-key-well-being">Science Proves That Gratitude Is Key to Well-Being (Psychology Today)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain">How Gratitude Changes You and Your Brain (Berkeley)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have always been interested in a lot of the ways our brains work, and how one can ultimately be happy and healthy, so I love these findings. But it lead me to a few questions.</p>
  <p id="gratitudeQuestion"><b>What is gratitude? How can we apply it all the different parts of our lives?</b></p>
  </div>

  <h2>Finding gratitude & appreciation</h2>
  <p>The common mental image one might conjure up is sitting around with our families for Thanksgiving dinner, and fumbling to try come up with something good that happened to you over the week. Certainly, a big aspect of gratitude is being grateful for the people around us in all capacities. But something I’ve seen discussed less is how we can apply it our hobbies and the other passing moments that fill up the rest of our lives.</p>
  <p>I've come to believe several things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I think gratitude and appreciation go hand in hand.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>To actively appreciate something is to be grateful for something, and to be grateful for something is to be engaging in active appreciation for it.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Appreciation is a form of wonderment, of active attention.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Mindfully taking something in, giving it your attention, noticing all of the details about something, and being grateful for its existence.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>I believe it is a practice.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The more we actively seek to intimately get to know something, the more details we can notice about it and the more we can appreciate and be grateful for it as a whole.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Context is king.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The more we know about the details surrounding something, perhaps the historical or scientific context, the more we can understands how it came to be and what makes up its being.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

  <h1>Let's take a look at an example: Trees</h1>
    <p>We see them everywhere. You might know a few different sorts of trees. You might know how their leaves come to change color. You might appreciate them for their shade on a hot day, or for the oxygen they provide. And all those things might make you just a little bit more glad at their being there. Without some of those details you might not give them a moment, you might just walk or drive past them every day.</p>
    <p>But what if we dive deeper? Let’s take a quick look at some other incredible details about trees.</p>

    <img class="canopy" src="img/canopy.jpg" alt="Canopy of trees" />
      <div class="canopyText">
        <p>Trees are interconnected through a deep symbiotic relationship with mushrooms of all things. Underground the living organism of mushrooms is the mycelium, a network of small branchlike tubes underground. These tubes link up with the roots of trees and allow them to send water and nutrients between each other. The mushrooms in return receive some of the sugar (30%) that the trees photosynthesis from sunlight.</p>
        <blockquote cite="Peter Wohlleben, German forester and author">
          “All the trees here, and in every forest that is not too damaged, are connected to each other through underground fungal networks. Trees share water and nutrients through the networks, and also use them to communicate. They send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages." - Peter Wohlleben, German forester and author

      <div class="aspenText">
        <p> While fungus connects many different trees in a sort of network, something similarly confounding are networks of aspen trees. Entire groves of aspen trees can grow off the same root network. All the trees are genetically identical clones of each other. One grove, the Pando tree, is known as the largest living organism on earth. </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)">
          "Pando occupies 43 hectares (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons), making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms."

    <h1>Bringing it all together.</h1>
    <p>Sitting right beside you every day is this thing of such immense and magnificent design and creation. But we don’t know what we don’t know. These things have always been there, but until we stop to really give things our full attention, we never know. There's a depth to the world we drift past.</p>
    <p>It takes curiosity, and a momentary decision to dig deeper. The more we understand about our world and the things and people in it, the more we can engage in the wonders of existence. So get out there and dive in!</p>
