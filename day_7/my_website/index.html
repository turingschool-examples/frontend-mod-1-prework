        <h2> How it started for me </h2>
      <p> I started Mountain Biking almost ten years ago. It's possibly my favorite leisure activity that I have picked up so far in my life. I had been an avid skier for over 25 years, so careening down a mountain had become second nature to me at this point. My favorite part of skiing was fresh powder. It is an absolutely wonderful feeling to float down a mountain with the quiet feeling of soft squish beneath one's feet. The problem with powder is that it is there for a moment, and then it's gone. The great part about a full suspension bike is a person can feel the soft squish while cruising down a mountain most days of the year.

          <h2> A brief recent history of Mountain Bikes   </h2>
          <p> Frame design is probably the most important design feature of modern Mountain Bikes. Not long ago only light, uphill friendly cross-country bikes had 29" wheels, all other mountain bikes had 26" wheels. The nice thing about a larger wheel is that it has more leverage to roll over a given obsticle, which helps maintain speed. The problem with a larger wheel is that it is less manuverable that a 26" wheel which made it less desirable for high speed downhill riders or anyone that wants to go off jumps.

          <p> This is where frame design comes in. Essentially, bike manufacturers were just modifing 26 inch wheel frames to fit the larger 29 inch wheels. World Cup downhill race teams started to figure out that the frames needed to be totaly redesigned from the ground up. Rather than the rider sitting on top of the wheels, the new frame designs put the rider between the wheels. This was done by streching out the wheelbase, making the headtube angle more 'slacked out' (putting the front wheel further forward) and also using a steeper (more upright) seattube angle. This increases stability and manuverability, making the 29 inch wheel much more desirable for all riders. So my advise is if you're looking to get a full suspension mountain bike, skip the 26 inch (and 27.5 inch) wheel models and go straight to the 29 inch wheel models.
