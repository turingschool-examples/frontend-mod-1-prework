  <h1>What I'm passionate about:</h1>
    <hr />
  <h3>My personal health and fitness:</h3>
      <p>Over the past couple of years I have been working toward my personal health and fitness. It's something I'm very passionate about because I have a family history of eating disorders. I too have expereinced body dysmorphia which I've overcome with a passion of weightlifting and health. I don't compete in fitness competions for weightlifting, to avoid getting into the same body-focused mindset.</p>

  <h3>Fitness for all:</h3>
      <p class="column1of2">My journey into accepting myself has made me passionate about encourging others to also except themselves and overcome body dysmorphia. Unfortunatly with the pressures of social media many young women have a unrealistic image of what they should look like. Many women are even turning to plasic surgey at a young age to fit in with what they see on social media.</p>

      <p class="column2of2">Social media has had an huge impact on young woemen and men, who compare themselves to influencers. The article <cite>Faking it: how selfie dysmorphia is driving people to seek surgery</cite> illistrates how much of an impact this can have on young people.
