      <h1>Rock Climbing</h1>
      <div class="column1of2">
      <h2>Various Disciplines</h2>
        <div style="width:570px; height:675px; line-heighgt: 3em; overflow: auto; padding:5px;">
        <ul>
          <li>Bouldering</li><br />

            <p>The majority of climbers are primarily boulderers, because it is the easiest point of access. It's the cheapest way to get into climbing since less gear is required; only shoes, chalk, and (a) crash pad(s). Boulders are about 20 feet or less, although sometimes people will climb even taller boulders, called "high balls". High balls are very dangerous and not recommended since the crash pad below will do little to protect a fall from that height.</p>
          <li>Sport Climbing</li><br />

            <p>Sport climbing is a style of climbing that utilizes established routes put in place with bolts. The climber clips a piece of equipment into the bolts on the wall that can clip into their rope (attached to their harness). Sport climbing goes over "face features" of a rock wall rather than cracks, typically. This style of climbing is usually done in one pitch (a ropes length or less).</p>
          <li>Traditional (or trad) Climbing</li><br />

            <img src="https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/l99AkILRfbhItkOexZjUO_GWe-g=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Yosemite_ElCap_CoreyRich_GettyImages_2-57152adc3df78c3fa2d11a93.jpg" class="standard" alt="trad_climbing_gear" title="trad_lotsa_gear" />
            <p>This discipline of climbing involves much more gear. A route does not have to be pre-established for a climber to ascend it for this style. That is why it's sometimes considered "adventure climbing", you can find and establish your own routes. Although, there are more dangers at play for those scenarios.<br />
              In trad climbing, pieces of gear are placed into the natural cracks in the rock wall, that are then attached to the rope. This climbing is more dangerous because gear pieces are much more likely to pop out of the wall, or zipper, when a climber does not place the gear properly. This is the style used in multi-pitch climbing, the method used to climb in places like Yosemite, allowing climbing to get hundreds to thousands of feet off the ground.</p>
          <li>Alpine</li><br />
            <img src="https://kmaconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Harry-on-PG-e1453421088174.jpg" class="standard" alt="rmnp_climbing" title="rmnp_alpine" />
            <p>Alpine climbing is much like trad climbing, but in an alpine environment. So weather conditions are considered, and more gear may be necessary to ascend the snowy or icey approaches to a rock pinnacle.</p>
          <li>Ice and Mixed Climbing</li><br />
            <img src="https://www.flightnetwork.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Copy-of-mountain_skill_academy-600x400.jpg" class="standard" alt="ice_waterfall" title="ice_climbing" /><br />
            <img src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mtnguide.net/2016/10/mixed.new_.1-1.jpg" class="standard" alt="mixed_climbing" title="mixed_climbing" />
            <p>Ice climbing utilizes the same setup as basic rock climbing, but crampons for the feet and ice tools for the hands are incorporated. A climber must be able to read the ice conditions to know how stable the wall is. This is important for screwing in ice screws used for securing ropes to the wall. <br />
            Mixed climbing is a combination of rock climbing and ice climbing. Climbers will "dry tool" with the ice tool being put on dry rock.</p>
          <li>Mountaineering</li><br />

            <p>Climbing is often mistaken for mountaineering (maybe less so in Colorado), but they are different. Mountaineering can encompass rock or ice climbing, as well as skiing; it is when one ascends a complete mountain. Expitions up Everest or K2 are big examples of this.</p><br /><br />

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p><span class="cursive">I've been climbing for 6 years and won't ever, ever stop. It's very fun and exhilerating, it takes me to some incredible places. If you're interested, I encourage you to get involved! It was really intimidating to me when I started, and I didn't know anyone else who climbed. But I really wanted to and was kind of fueled by the exclusivity of it.</span><br /><br />
          Join a local climbing gym and go at least twice a week, any less than that you won't see or keep any progress you make.<br /><br />
          Also, there are loads of technical skill to know for safety. Rope systems, knots, etc. Courses at the gym are great, but AMGA (American Mountain Guide Association) courses are even better. Especially if you get into trad, getting higher off the ground. If your body is suspended even more than 30 feet off the ground, you really want to make sure you understand the systems backwards and forwards. User error is the biggest cause for accidents, not gear malfunction.</p>
