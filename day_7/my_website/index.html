    <h1> The Heart and Soul of Denver</h1>
    <h2>Addressed To: Five Points, Colorado </h2>
    <blockquote class="one">"It isn't where you came from; it's where you're going that counts."<br /> - Ella Fitzgerald </blockquote>
    <p> Throughout Denver's history, Five Points
      and the Whittier neighborhood, located northeast of downtown,
       have been a sanctuary for the Black community.
       It was a bustling and well known community. At one point
       people would address letters to Five Points, Colorado like
       it was its own town. </p>

       <p>Most Blacks in Denver worked as railroad porters,
        waiters, or domestic servants, but Five Points was also
         home to a growing number of Black professionals and office
          workers. Dr. Justina Ford, for decades the city’s only Black woman
  physician, worked from 1902 to 1952 out of her home and
  office at 2335 Arapahoe Street. In 1919 Samuel Cary
    became the state’s first licensed Black attorney and
            established his office in Five Points. The American
             Woodmen Insurance Company employed more Black office
              workers than any other business in Denver.</p>

    <h2> What They Built</h2>

<blockquote class="two">"I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues."
  <br /> -Duke Ellington </blockquote>

<p>The Glenarm branch of the YMCA was built in 1924 and
acted as the unofficial Town Hall of Five Points. Denver’s
branch of the NAACP was established and hosted its first national
 meeting in 1925 to address the racial hostility and inequality
 perpetuated by the KKK’s firm hold on Denver politics and
 society. </p>
 <p>In 1927, a group of Black students successfully sued
 the Superintendent of Public Instruction of Denver for the
 unconstitutional separation of social functions for students
 based on race. Five points had established itself as a
 political center for the advancement of equality as more and more
 of its residents began to own property and establish businesses.</p>

 <p>Five Points not only survived a time of extreme, institutionalized
 racial oppression in Colorado, but thrived and grew to become one
 of the most culturally rich destinations in
 the country. </p>

      <p>From the opening of Benny Hooper’s hotel and recreation
      center for Black servicemen in the 1920s, Five Points has
      been synonymous with jazz. It was the kind of place
      where every
      home had a piano and kids in every family grew up knowing
      how to play an instrument.</p>

      <p> Venues like the Casino Cabaret, Lil’s, and Benny Hooper’s
      Ex-Servicemen’s Club made Five Points THE
      place to hear jazz between the Midwest and the West Coast.
      The most important jazz club in Five Points was the Rossonian
      Lounge, known as the best jazz club between kansas city and LA.
      Top Black musicians who visited Denver often stayed
      at the Rossonian Hotel because White-only hotels turned them away.
      They would play in the hotel’s first-floor lounge,
        between concerts at larger venues downtown, or late at night
        after returning to the hotel. Over the years the lounge
        hosted a long list of distinguished musicians, including
        Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Miles Davis,
      Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nat King Cole.</p>

      <h2> Things Ain't What They Used To Be</h2>
    <blockquote class="three"> "I'm always making a comeback but nobody ever tells me where I've been." <br /> - Billie Holiday </blockquote>
<p>Gentrification poses a challenge to the character of Five Points
as housing prices and property taxes increase.Today, many recognize the neighborhood’s important history, and
efforts to renew
and revitalize the neighborhood have begun to pay off.
Five Points received an historic district designation and
important buildings along Welton Street have received state
preservation money for restoration. </p>

<p>Five Points has become one of Denver’s most desirable
neighborhoods, with home prices rising far above the median for
 the city. While this new influx of residents and businesses to
 the area has assured its survival and revitalization,
 the drastically inflated cost of living has driven out many
 of the same residents who fought for its preservation. Though
 Five Points now hosts its annual Jazz Fest and Juneteenth
 festival, drawing 50,000 visitors to the area to celebrate its
 cultural heritage, it was Denver’s strong, black community that
 made the neighborhood a haven, a hotspot, and a home for decades
 in the face of oppression.</p>
