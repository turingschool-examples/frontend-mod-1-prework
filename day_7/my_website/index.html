    <p>Runner David Babcock broke a Guinness World Record for his time in the Kansas City marathon: five hours, 48 minutes, and 27 seconds. If you’re wondering what’s so special about his time, he managed to run the entire race while knitting a scarf that measured over 12 feet long!(<a href="https://brownsheep.com/yarn-and-knitting-facts-you-probably-never-knew/"> Brown Sheep Co</a>)</p>
      <p>In 1527, the first knitting union was established in Paris, France — and no women were allowed to join. After the knitting machine was invented in the late 1500s, knitting by hand became a useful hobby, rather than a necessity.

    <p>Yarn is a long, continuous length of fibers that have been spun or felted together. Yarn is used to make cloth by knitting, crocheting or weaving. Yarn is sold in the shape called a skein to prevent the yarn from becoming tangled or knotted. Yarns come in many thicknesses or weights from fine to thick: lace, fingering, sock, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran, bulky, and super-bulky.(<a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Yarn"> Kiddle Encylodeia</a>)</p>
    <p>The most commonly used yarn color types are those with a single uniform hue. However, there are also other color types available such as: heathered or tweed, ombre, multicolored, self-striping, marled which is yarn that is made from strands of different-colored yarn twisted together.(<a href="https://www.americanyarns.com.au/some-facts-about-yarn/">American Yarns</a>
