      Puppies I'm Obsessed With
    </h1>
      <p>
      In my opinion, the greatest gift this world has been given is puppies. It is believed that dogs and humans have coexsisted for atleast 16,000 years. Although some argue that it has been doube that amount of time. It could have been a billion years. It wouldn't change my mind, dogs are the greatest.

      Why I Love Puppies
    </h2>
      <p>
      Although I did not have the chance to grow up with puppie (my moms choice, not mine), I have always dearly loved dogs. Puppies don't care what you look like, if you bothered to take shower that day, or what ou do for a living. They just want to love you unconditionaly and are just thrilled that you're home. They are so innocent because all they want is a head scratch, lots of belly rubs, and all the treats you are willing to share. The way they smile at your and wag their tails when they are happy, melts my heart.
