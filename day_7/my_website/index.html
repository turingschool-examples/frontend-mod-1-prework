      <p> The Real Houswives franchise documents the lives of affluent women across multiple cities.  There have been a total of 9 cities with a Real Housewives show.  Seven are currently still being filmed.  The first city filmed for the show was Orange County, which premiered in 2006.  Multiple spin-off shows have been created from this franchise, and there are even international versions.</p>
