  <h2 background-color: ##2F9395>Bio</h2>
<p>Linus is a Denver based commedian who got his start in China doing open mic shows in English.  Since then, he's been all over the world performing comedy since 2018 including the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shenzhen, China</li>
  <li>Hong Kong</li>
  <li>Bangkok</li>
  <li>Boulder</li>
  <li>Unsuspecting people at bars</li>
  <li>Denver</li>

  <p> See what ShenzhenNOW has to say about him!     <blockquote font-family="serif">Linus Leas is another up and comer. He came onto the Shenzhen scene a few months ago, but his stuff is very fresh. He was the opening act for the Dongguan show as well and the experience he grabbed that night can be applied to all the material he is writing.”

As luck would have it, Leas actually popped into the open mic night later that evening to perform a set and it’s clear to see why Mr. Ryan is so excited about him. Leas is Cambodian-American. As an Asian-looking expat living in China, he’s got a rich amount of material to mine. While hearing about the typical expat experience in China might be a bit too familiar for some, Leas occupies a space which feels much fresher.</blockquote>
