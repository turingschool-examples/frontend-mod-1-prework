      <h2 > The Land in Between </h2>
        <p>Texas has been home for the last decade and a half. It doesn't have the most spectacular climbing, but it's speckled with natural springs that nourish the soul during the summer months. The Austin area is home to many short limestone cliffs that offer some great climbing on polished rock.
          Adventure can be found at <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105855196/enchanted-rock-state-natural-area" target="_blank"> Enchanted Rock State Natural Area </a>, the second largest monolithic granite dome in the States, and the only nearby opportunity to climb granite.
          The cracks here are unfriendly; tape gloves are not recommended, but mandatory. Not everything is a sandbag, but many things are. That's why I love it; Everything elsewhere is relatively easier or the same. I would say the lack of uniform cracks here prepared me perfectly for the flaring cracks of
          <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105801865/estes-park-valley" target="_blank"> Estes Park's </a> <i> Lumpy Ridge </i>. The many moments of furstration placing gear on seemingly short routes paid off big time halfway up on a multi-pitch. </p>

          <p> My favorite thing about my previous job is the traveling it allowed me to do. Four weekends of pedaling a tricycle through the desert
            was a small price to pay for the time in between exploring world-class granite. <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105788031/tahquitz-rock" target="_blank"> Taquitz Rock</a> and
            it's neighbor Suicide rock were a crucible to the beginning of climbing in the United States. Before becoming a Yosemite legend, Royal Robbins honed his
            skills at Taquitz where he pioneered the now-benchmark 5.9 <i>Open Book</i>. <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105720495/joshua-tree-national-park" target="_blank"> Joshua Tree </a> is well known for being
            difficult, but this didn't stop the "Stonemasters" from making it their playground. They, too, pushed boundries and became Yosemite legends. Given their early appearance into climbing, these areas are known to
            be mostly "trad", that is, one places protection as they climb. </p>
            <p>Further north, we find <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105788989/smith-rock" target="_blank"> Smith Rocks </a>, the forefront of "sport" climbing in the United States. The
            rock is not granite, but volcanic ash compacted together. When I was there I didn't climb many of the sport classic, because the lower gorge (a sub-area) had some amazing basalt cracks to offer. </p>

      <p> The class of sandstone that make up the Appalachia Mountains is some of my favorite to climb on.
      The rock varies in softness through out the mountains. The hard-packed sandstone of the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105855991/the-new-river-gorge" target="_blank"> New River Gorge </a>
      has a different character than the softer, more featured, sandstone of the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105841134/red-river-gorge" target="_blank"> Red River Gorge </a>.
      Each are known for differnt styles of climbing; both are extremely fun. At <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105883248/foster-falls" target="_blank"> Foster Falls </a>, a balance is struck
      and both "trad" and "sport" climbing can be found.</p>
      <p> I usually visit in the summer when there is a lushness to the Appalchias that's almost overwhelming. The towering trees, creeping vines, buzzing insects, and suffocating summer humidity
      never abandon you. At times, when this is almost too much, a summertime breeze will pass to remind you of the beauty of these lands and the mysteries they once held. </p>

        <h2> Mexico </h2>
          <p> Mexico being my home country, I am surprised that suddenly I have explored less of it
              than the Unites States. Most of my time there has been in my home state of San Luis Potosi. As far as climbing goes,
              I mostly spend time in Northern Mexico at Potrero Chico. Ironically, none of the pictures on this section are of EPC, as is commonly known amongst climbers.
              It does boast many moderate routes that can be up to 20 pitches in length. The pictures on this section are of my last trip to northern Mexico which included an area known as "El Salto" or the Jump.
              As can be seen, it's stunning with walls that go on for miles (it's impressive for someone out of Texas)</P>
          <p>In the near future, I want to motre deliberatly explore other climbing in Mexico. First, I want to focus in Guadalajara, and eventually explore the yet to be explored (climbing wise, that is).</p>

      <p>It's wonderful how this trip just sort of happened. The idea originated in Angela as a way to reconnnect with her heritage. She invited our friend Scott when he was passing through Colorado on the way back to Texas from Canada.
        He in turn orchastrated a group that didn't all know one another, but were all equally down to come along. For two weeks, we climbed and co-existed exploring a new land and culture while being guided by our wonderful friend, Angela.
        It's pretty bizarre how total stranger can click sometimes. For Angela, holding the "Live your Dream" sign, it was an emotional experience to reconnect with her family and culture after over a decade away. I am grateful that she was willing
      to bring us all along and share in her dream. It elevated the whole experience.    </p>
