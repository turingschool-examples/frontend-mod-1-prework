  <h1>How It All Began. . .The First Bite!</h1>

  <div class="column1of2">
  <p>I was very young when I was first bit by the Bug. I'm not sure how young, but I can tell you that I was small enough to climb behind the rear seat of the Bug and just hang out! If you've ever seen the back of an old Bug, then you know, they are very small.  This particular Bug was my Great Aunt Jeanie's (RIP).  Surprisingly, it's still in the family!  I use to love to ride with her to the grocery store in that Bug.  She even had a matching toy version of her Bug that I use to play with every visit.  Needless to say, this is where and when I was first <strong class="italic">bit</strong> by the VW Bug.
  </p>

  <div class="column2of2">
  <p>Some day I hope to own it.  I think it should continue to stay in the family, don't you?  Currently Aunt Jeanie's son, Richard, has it tucked away just waiting to be restored. It would be a huge disapointment if he sold it to someone else.  Which reminds me, I need to get my <q>best people</q> on this stat!  By people I mean his cousin, my mom.  You see, I don't know him that well.  My mom is my best bet though, since she's now living in Monrovia, CA again, which is where the Bug has survived it's whole life.</p>

  <p>The second time I was bit by the bug, was when my dad got my older brother a bug as his first car.  I got to watch a learn as they worked on that thing to get it road worthy.  Did you know it only takes 4 bolts to remove an engine in allmost all VWs up until the 90s?  Crazy right?!  It's seriously that easy.  Needlesss to say, I think I was destined to have a Bug be my first car too, and in my junior year in high school I got one!  It was a 1965 VW Bug for $750!  It was a piece of work for sure, but it was mine!  I once heard this great quote, <q>A poor ride is better than a proud walk.</q>. That most certainly was the case for me.  I loved that Bug even though it was very much a poor ride.  Pittiful actually.  One thing's for sure, I didn't have to walk anymore!  Well, so long as I had money for gas. ;)

 <h2>The Rest is History</h2>

  <p>Some 30 years later, I am still obsessed and  tinkering with old VW's.  What can I say, I love them.

  <ul>
    <li>They are super cool looking.</li>
    <li>Easy to work on.</li>
    <li>And keep going up in value.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  That last part is only good when your selling by the way. lol. So many of the old VW's have become out of reach for most pockets.  The Barrett Jackson Auction has changed the market significantly.  Back in the 90's you could pick up a decent Split Window Bus for a couple grand.  Now you're paying upwards of 10k for a project bus!  Ouch!
  There's still some deals to be had out there.  I have got my hands on a few.  Currently I'm waiting for the time and money to restore a couple of those <q>deals</q>  One is a 1973 VW Thing. They were only imported to the States in 1973 and 1974. The other is a 1986 Transporter Syncro Doka.  These were never imported for sale in the U.S.  That's an entire story oof its own on how I got my hands on these.  Until next time volks! (Pro tip: "Volk" is German for people.)
