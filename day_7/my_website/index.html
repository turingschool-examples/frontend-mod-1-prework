        <p>I learned to cook from my grandmother, Mimi. Nightly she would produce a very American meal of protein, grains, and vegetables sometimes with a salad. Effortlessly, she would produce amazing meals that were perfectly timed and set out on the table at 6. We'd grab our plates and gather around the TV to watch Wheel of Fortune. This nightly ritual as well as the delicious meals held such a magical place in my heart that as I grew up and moved away from home I clung tightly to the craft of cooking. <br><br>
        Now, I'm not saying that I can open up my kitchen cupboards and pull random things out and make an amazing meal. I'm just not that creative, and that's not how I learned because that's not how Mimi cooked. She was a recipe lady; there was, and still is, an entire bookcase dedicated to cookbooks as well as a recipe box filled with recipe clippings from <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> and <i>Good Housekeeping</i>. In turn I love recipes-- a cookbook is always on my Christmas list and when I married another cooking lover our mailbox became over run with cooking magazines. <br><br>
        We had a ritual: Sunday mornings we would make coffee, sit around the dining room table and create a menu for the week. Which meant we could pour over our monthly subscriptions of <i>Bon Appetit</i>, <i>Allrecipes</i>, and <i>Southern Living</i>. If something looked good we'd tear the page out and put it off to the side. By the time we were done perusing the stack of magazines the table would be covered in the torn out pages. Over the years we've filled binders and have found little recipe clippings in kitchen drawers, inside other magazines, and scattered in other non culinary areas. In an attempt to organize our lives and actually create some of the things that we once felt excited about cooking I'm creating a place where all our favorite recipes can exist forever, in perfect consolidated harmony.

        <div class="recipe_intro">
          <p>Known to strengthen the immune system, break up congestion and fill your belly. This classic soup will have you feeling better before you know it. But, you don't have to be feeling under the weather to really enjoy this meal. This is my go to recipe whenever I have a craving for soup.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ingredients">
          <ul>
            <li>Chicken thighs (I use 1 lb)</li>
            <li>Avacado oil</li>
            <li>Half onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>Celery, chopped</li>
            <li>Jalapeno, sliced thin</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>Chicken broth (water and stalk)</li>
            <li>Bay leaf</li>
            <li>Assortment of vegetables</li>
            <li>Rice (or a starch you prefer)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <ol class="directions">
          <li>Coat pan with avacado oil over medium heat. Once oil is hot add chopped onion, carrots, celery, jalapeno.</li>
          <li>Add spices and salt, saute until onions are slightly transparent then add garlic. Cook for 1-2 min, mixing the garlic in with the other vegetables.</li>
          <li>Add desired amount of water and bring to a boil. I tend to go a little heavy on the water as I like to eat soup a few times a week. Once water is boiling add the chicken stock and bay leaf.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken thighs and other veggies, simmer for 20 min. I use thighs because they are dark meat and jucier.</li>
          <li>While chicken is cooking make rice in a seperate pot. As I said before I'll eat this soup throughout the week so I cook my starch seperately so it maintains its integrity.</li>
          <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper</li>
        </ol>
