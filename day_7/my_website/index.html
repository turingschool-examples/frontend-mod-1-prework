    <h1> Why I love running</h1>

<h2>It feels good</h2>
<p>I've run races in a dozen states. I've gone for solo runs in another dozen
  or so. Running is the one thing I can always count on. It requires so little,
  yet gives so much. Even when I've felt terrible and didn't want to run, once
  I've gone out for a run, I never regret doing so. Running also allows me to
  be a tourist in a completely different way when I travel- running around the
  National Mall in DC, the Waterfront in Chicago, and Central Park in New York
  allow you to take in those sights while doing something beneficial for
  yourself, and you do so in a way that doesn't scream <i>typical tourist</i>.

<h2>Community</h2>
<p> Running also allows me to find community. I got into running because a group
  of people from a bootcamp I attended also had a running group. I thought they
  were fun people and I wanted to be friends with them so I started running with
  them, even though I hated it at first! I kept at it, and eventually I didn't
  hate running anymore. I started seeking out additional running groups, usually
  attached to a brewery, because why not combine the things I enjoy- running,
  beer, and making friends! Running was how I made new friends when I moved to
  Denver from Atlanta last year- the first thing I did when I got to town was
  look up running groups in the area. Having a place to go and making friends
  made the move feel a lot less scary than it could have been.

<ol>
    <li><b>Dead Horse Ultra 50k-</b> Moab, Utah. Hands down, the most beautiful race
      I've ever participated in. Also, Moab is my favorite place!</li>
    <li><b>New York City Marathon-</b> New York, New York. This was my first marathon, and no race has ever
      matched the energy and crowd support of this event.</li>
    <li><b>Houston Half Marathon-</b> Houston, TX. I ran this race with a dear friend of mine. It was her
      first race post-baby and she had a goal to make beat her personal record
      for the distance. We pushed and she beat her previous time by 10 whole
      minutes- which is huge in running! It was also my birthday weekend and I
      got so much encouragement from other runners...including a few songs!</li>
    <li><b>Ragnar Trail Atlanta-</b> Atlanta, GA. Every April, I run this race
      in Atlanta with the same amazing group of women. We camp and take turns
      running trails of varying lengths, relay style, until our team has run a
      total of 120 miles, which ends up being about 15 miles per person. In
      between runs, we hang out at our campsite...sort of like a 24 hour
      tailgating party with run breaks!</li>

  <p>Are you interested in running but not sure where to start? For all of my races,
    I have followed various training plans by
    <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training/" target="_blank">Hal Higdon</a>.
    They are really well thought out, and you can choose a plan based on your
    personal level of experience and the goals you'd like to achieve. He has
    plans for distances starting at 5k up to Marathon.<p>
