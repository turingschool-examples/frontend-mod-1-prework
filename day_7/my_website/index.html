    <h2> Creativity  </h2>
      <p> A large reason I want to be a web developer is because of the creative process. Whether making your own website, a website for someone else, an app, an algorithm, or anything else codeable, you are making a vison come to life. Creating is a very rewarding thing, even though it can be frustrating at times. Being able to look a something and say "I made that from scratch!" and being proud of the quality of your work, is the main reason I want to be a web developer.

    <h3> An Industry Here to Stay </h3>
      <p> The world has transitioned into a more technological place. Newspapers, magazines, and other physical media are being transitioned into web content. Even cable TV has been losing its veiwer base to streaming websites. As time goes on and more countries/people gain access to the world wide web, there is going to be more demand for websites and people to manage those sites. Having the ability to code is, in my opinion, going to be invaluable in the near future. It is a skill <span class="i">already highly sought after</span>, and will continue to be as the world continues to use computers.
