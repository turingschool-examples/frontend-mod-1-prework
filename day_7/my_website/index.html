  <h1><ins>How to Fit Climbing Shoes</ins></h1>

  <div id="trees">
    <h3>What is our goal?</h3>
        <p1>Our goal is help provide the most accurate fit of a climbing shoe via online. Buying climbing shoes can be a huge pain. Going from gear shop to gear shop, looking to see if they might have your size to try on. While purchasing shoe online can be a bige risk. Never knowing if you are geting the right size. With our site, we want to help all climbers, from new to experienced, everyone should be able to buy a show confidently and without the stress of guessing. We can't guarantee that it is the perfect fit but we will try and get the accurate fit possible.</p1>
    <h3>What fit is recommended?</h3>
        <p2>This is where it can be tricky. Fit is honestly a personal preference. You will here some say that your shoes need to be extremely tight and uncomfortable. Others will say that a relaxed fit is more preferable. Everyone has their own preference for fit. And you won't know how you want your shoes to fit until you have gone thru multiple pairs of shoes, in different styles, and fit. For a beginner it is suggested that they go for a more "comfortable" fit. The reason behind this is that a new climber hasn't adjusted to how climbing shoes fot. Also, the muscles in their foot aren't as strong as those who have been climbing for several years. That doesn't mean they can't go for an aggressive shoe, if their heart so desires. They will just more likely be in a lot of pain as they go about breaking in their shoe. Trying on as many shoes as possible is gonna be a key part in all of this. Even if they have no intention of buying those shoes, it is great to compare one model to another. All shoe companies make their shoes completely different so there really won't be any similarities in size most likely.</p2>
    <h3>Style of Shoes</h3>
      <h4>Trad and Crack Climbing</h4>
        <p3>Traditional climbing can involve an enormous array of techniques, but when people refer to a "trad shoe," they usually mean less aggressive shoes that are designed for crack climbing. Typically, for crack climbs, you want a shoe that allows the toes to lay flat for added comfort when you're stuffing them inside a crack.</p3>
      <h4>Bouldering and Sport Climbing</h4>
        <p3>As a good rule of thumb, the steeper the climbing gets, the more aggressive or downturned you want your shoe to be. Aggressive shoes are all shaped so the shoe "turns down" from the heel to the toe. When worn, these shoes cause your foot to arch, allowing you to direct more power through the toe.</p3>
      <h4>Gym Climber and Beginner Shoes</h4>
        <p3>For this level, shows are going to be flatter, stiffer, and cheaper in terms of price and material. Typically, inexpensive, entry-level shoes won't climb as well â€” but this is not a hard and fast rule. If you find the right shoe, forking out a little extra cash is worth it to have something that you can grow with, and that won't hold you back. Irrespective of the price, the shoe needs to be comfortable. Not grandma's slippers comfortable, but something you can easily tolerate wearing for a while. For gym climbing, get whatever suits your climbing ambitions. We often size tight and aggressive for steep routes and bouldering and maintain a flatter, looser fit if you're new to climbing, cruising, or just getting some exercise.</p3>
