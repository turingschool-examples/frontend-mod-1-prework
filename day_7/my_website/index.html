        <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
        <p>Dungeons and Dragons aka. D&D is a tabletop role playing game that was first published in 1974 by <strong>Gary Gygax</strong> and <strong>Dave Arneson</strong>. The game has been through several revisions and editions, with 5th Edition being the current version. D&D is structure, yet incredibly open. There are basic rules and settings, but is infinitely playable with tons of off-the-shelf adventures. You can also create your own world with your own challenges and monsters, which is called a <strong>Homebrew</strong>. Players roll a variety of polyhedral dice based on what they are trying to do. The majority of decision making rolls are done using a 20 sided die, or d20.</p>
