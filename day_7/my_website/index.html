<h1> Anatomy of the Harts </h1>
<h3> A Semi-Complete and Mostly True Family History </h3>

<p> I consider myself a realist. I ditch rose-colored glasses in favor of the truth whenever possible. Despite this, I realized recently that, at least on a subconcious level, I believed that my maternal grandmother would live forever. When speaking with my cousins at her wake, they all had similar feelings. It seemed unbelievably odd that someone so dynamic and full of life could be allowed to die. </p>
<p>My granny was the true definition of a matriarch, guiding her eight children and twenty grandchildren (and two great-grandchildren) with grace, compassion, ease, and occasional micromanagement. Though we were and are a bountiful people, we gathered as a whole group often due to her efforts to instill a sense of family and tradition in us all. The group often included friends, step-family members, and family members by marriage as well. Everyone had a seat at her table (or tables, as was necessitated by the sheer number of attendants).</p>
<p class="note">To avoid waxing poetic about her life and accomplishments, I will link to <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/abqjournal/obituary.aspx?n=joan-m-hart&pid=194213871">her obituary</a> for those interested. </p>
<p> This gathering of family and celebration of my granny's life lead to my reflecting on the traditions she created for our family. Some of these traditions created a sense of magic, some a sense of confusion, some a begrudging sense of duty, but they all created stories and brought us together as a family. <p>

<h4> Here's a sample of some of our family traditions: </h4>
<ul>
<li> Lake Powell
  <br>Always one for adventure, my granny wrangled her children and grandchildren every summer for over 50 years for a week on a houseboat at Lake Powell. As the group grew, this turned into two and then three houseboats to contain all of us.</li> <br>
<li> Noel Bags
  <br> With eight children, purchasing Christmas gifts wasn't always economically feasible. Instead, my granny created the idea of Noel Bags, homemade gifts made in bulk by each child and distributed to their siblings on Christmas Eve. With the introduction of grandchildren, this turned into each family group creating something for the other groups. Some particularly memorable examples were homemade guitars, painted toilet seats, mix CDs, and painted fish bowls with live fish. If someone was unsure what to make, my granny's suggestion was always a <a href="https://www.starofthesea.net/spiritual-bouquet/">spiritual bouquet,</a> which perhaps ranks even lower on the Christmas gift list than socks for most children. </li> <br>
<li> A Christmas Carol
  <br> Each year, my granny had her children perform the Dickens play, <em class="playTitle"> A Christmas Carol </em> from an adapted script (also homemade, if I remember correctly). Naturally, this duty was later passed down to grandchildren and I have many memories of awkwardly playing Scrooge's teenage love interest alongside my cousin cast as teenage Scrooge. I even roped my now-husband into playing a part one Christmas while we were still dating (trial by fire is sort of our thing). </li> <br>
<li> Pranks
  <br> I debated making a separate section dedicated just to pranks. I joke that there is a mischief gene that gets passed down from my granny to select family members (my brother and I got it, my sister didn't). This mischief gene is best observed through our long history of family pranks. From a tumbleweed in my uncle Patrick's bed each year in the days before Christmas to short-sheeting the beds of visiting family members, there always seems to be something sneaky in the works. When my aunts and uncles attempted to date as teenagers, my grandparents orchestrated various pranks on their dates (again, trial by fire). This could be lining up the other seven siblings to toss rice as the couple left the house for their date, or having the youngest hide in the backseat of the car and pop up once the pair was just far enough from home. </li>
</ul>
