        <h2>Maintaining Our Trails</h2>
        <img id="img2" src="images/mudd.jpg" alt="Muddy, Rutted, Ruined Trail" title="A Muddy, rutted and ruined trail.">
        <p> Tough weather conditions with record rains, snow and freeze-thaw can make it frustrating for us mountain bikers (AND volunteer groups that maintain the trails). During these times, some don’t ride at all or opt to ride the road or stationary bikes. Others, out of desperation, ride the same trails they always do. Unfortunately, our trails in Colorado aren't meant to handle moisture quite like the Pacific Northwest. Riding wet trails in Colorado causes permenant damage to the trail. A good rule of thumb is that if you can leave the impression of your tires or foot on the ground, the trail is not ready to be ridden.
            <br>
            <br> Timing is pretty key, but choosing the right trails is also important. Bad conditions can be difficult to judge from afar during the fall, winter and spring which can be freqeuntly sloppy. It can quickly turn into a science. Our trail reporting system is meant to alleviate the trial and error in choosing where to ride during these seasons.</p>

        <p id="important"><b>IMPORTANT FACT:</b> Jefferson County, the City of Lakewood, and the US Forest Service DO NOT have paid trail crews! Nearly all of the work that goes into maintaining these trails are through VOLUNTEER efforts COORDINATED by fellow mountain bikers.</p>
        <div class="lists" id="tips">
            <p> <u>Tips:</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li> When trails are in a freeze/thaw cycle, ride before noon while the ground is still solid.</li>
                <li> Running stairs can be an excellent alternative training for MTBing in the winter when trails are closed.</li>
                <li> If a trail receives more than an inch of rain, it will generally need 24 hours of dry weather before it is ready to be ridden.</li>
                <li> When encountering a rogue puddle of mudd, ride through it's center, not around, as to not widen the trail.</li>
