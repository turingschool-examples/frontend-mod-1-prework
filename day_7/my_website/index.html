    <p class="content">I like horror movies. I like them so much Iâ€™ve seen too many to remember their titles, even the good ones. I remember watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/">Nightmare On Elm Street</a> when I was around 8 years old, probably not the best parenting choice. Theyâ€™re my go-to for background noise when Iâ€™m not actually paying attention to the TV, with the exception of music. What is it that has myself and so many others fascinated with this genre?</p>

      <h2>How horror movies affect your brain</h2>

      <p class="caption">Your brain on Horror</p>
      <p class="content">Turns out horror movies have some pretty interesting affects on your brain. Some may assume these affects would be undoubtedly negative, but thatâ€™s not completely true. To your brain, what you see on screen is very real. The images you see and especially the sounds trigger the same part of your brain thatâ€™s responsible for fight-or-flight.
      </p>
      <p class="content">You get a boost of adrenaline, which in-turn increases your heart rate. The rush we experience in being scared is actually addicting and thatâ€™s why many of us keep going back for more. Itâ€™s funny to think you paid the cost of a movie ticket to feel scared and anxious, but people do this all the time. You know that youâ€™re watching a work of fiction, yet you still get nervous, scream, and jump out of your seat.
      </p>
      <p class="content">The good news: watching horror movies burns calories! According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9638876/Watching-horror-films-burns-nearly-200-calories-a-time.html">The Telegraph</a>, you can burn about 184 calories just by sitting on the couch watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/">The Shinning</a>. If youâ€™re in need of a New Yearâ€™s resolution, let this be some inspiration.

      <p class="content">Basically, theyâ€™re cheap to make and have a better return on investment than other genres. They may not be dirt cheap, but they are certainly one of the cheapest genres out there. In 2014-2018, the median budget for a feature horror film released domestically was under 10 million. Ok, that probably sounds like a lot of money, but itâ€™s really just a drop in a bucket for the film industry.
      </p>
      <p class="content">The horror genre is perfect for filmmakers with little to no budget. You donâ€™t need CGI, well-known actors, or even a decent camera, talking about you found footage movies. This is also the reason they are fairly profitable. According to <a href="https://stephenfollows.com/how-much-does-the-average-movie-cost-to-make/">stephenfollows.com</a>, "Horror hugely outperforms other genres, collecting an average of 2.3 times its production budget at the box office."
