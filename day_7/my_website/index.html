      <p>Estes was born in Kansas City, MO in February of 2014; he was adopted by a woman named Stacey at eight weeks old, he lived with her for four months. He had a lot of energy, and he was too much for her to handle at the time, so he moved in with my spouse and me when he was six months old. He was a 90lb <a href = "http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/labradoodle">Labradoodle</a>, he had a lot of energy, and he was very smart. He was a very playful dog that is curious about everyone and everything. When Estes was five years old, he was diagnosed with aggressive T-cell Lymphoma; he never made it to six years old. He was a good boy, and he is missed.

      <p>
        Peaches was found living under an abandoned house in Oklahoma with her puppies. She was brought to Colorado along with her puppies by Happy Landings Animal Rescue in Ft. Collins and treated for heartworms. When we adopted her in 2015 she was thought to be four to six years old but no one was quite sure because she seems to have lived a hard life. Peaches is a 30lb <a href = "http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/10-reasons-to-love-a-mutt">mutt</a> that was scared of the world, but she has become far less timid over the years. She is the queen of the house and she rules from her own Ikea throne.

      <p>
        Zeke was found in Amarillo, TX in 2019, he was brought to Colorado by Big Bones Canine Rescue in Ft. Collins. He spent a few months living with a family in Ft. Collins, however, he was returned to the rescue due to his bad behavior. We adopted him on  December 7th, 2019 he is thought to be two to three years old, but no one is quite sure. Zeke is a 55lb <a href = "http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/basset-hound">Bassethound</a> and <a href = "http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/american-pit-bull-terrier">Pit Bull Terrier</a> mix that is scared of life. He has only lived with us for about a month, but he is starting to come out of his shell. At times he is a bit larger and stronger than he realizes, and he needs reminders to be gentle.
