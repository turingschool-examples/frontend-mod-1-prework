        <h2 id="about"><span>History</span></h2>
            <p>The Sims franchise was created in 2000 by Will Wright. He created the franchise partly
              to show the dangers of consumerism and how accumulating more stuff will not
              make people happy. For instance, in the Sims electronics can break constantly.
              While not having a dishwasher, laptop, or high-definition television set can be inconvenient,
              once a Sim has accumulated enough wealth to buy these items, they must constantly fix
              and maintain them. </p>

            <p>The first Sims game was released in 2000. Will Wright came up with the idea for the game after losing all of his possessions in a fire.
            In the first Sims game, all of the Sims lived in a small town near SimCity, a video game franchise that is the predecessor to the Sims 4. SimCity was also created by Will Wright.
            By the time development of this game ended, there were seven expansion packs. </p>

            <p> The Sims 2 was released in 2004 and the events of the game take place 25 years after The Sims.  </p>

            <p>The Sims 3 was released in the summer of 2009. With it came a new feature, <em>open world</em>. In an open world game,
            the entire game is available all at once without loading screens dividing various sections. For example, the player could watch
            as their sims biked to school or carpooled to work. (Additionally, while these buildings were still <em>rabbitholes</em> - places inside which
            the player can never see - they did exist in this game.) This also made it easier to switch from sim to sim within the same active
            household. However, it also meant that it could sometimes take hours for a single game to load. </p>

          class="SimsGameplay">
            <p>The Sims 4 was released in 2014, the fourth iteration of the Sims franchise.
              At inital release, the game lacked common staples of the franchise such as toddlers,
              swimming pools, and cars. Toddlers and swimming pools were later added to the game in free
              updates, but many users still lament the lack of cars.</p>
            <p>An interesting update to the game has been the addition of multitasking and a more complex emotional
              system than in prior games. For example, it's now possible to feel several emotions at once and for
              these emotions to affect how a Sim perceives a particular interaction.</p>
        <h2 id="mods-and-cc"><span>Mods and Custom Content</span></h2>
            <p>Since it's impossible for game developers to create all content that people would like to have in a
              particular game, they often rely on users themselves to create mods and custom content that meet this need.
              <em>Mods</em> are scripts that change important elements of the game. For example, the popular mod
              <a href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/" target="_blank">MC Command Center</a> adds story progression, which affects the lives of
              non-player characters. For instance, this mod can further an NPC's character, marry them, and give them offspring,
              all while the player continues playing their active household.</p>
            <p><em>Custom content</em> is made up of non-script elements that volunteers create in order to edit the game. For example,
              someone might recolor a shirt that was created by EA for use in the game - this would make more color options available.
              Most custom content is created using the 3D software Blender.</p>
