   <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
   <br>
     <p class = "a"> "Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us."<br>
       "It suggests that the mind is fully attending to what’s happening, to what you’re doing, to the space you’re moving through."
<br>
       (<a href="https://www.mindful.org/what-is-mindfulness/">source</a>)
<br>
   <div class = "a">Some ideas on how to practice mindfulness:
<ul>
  <li>Meditation</li>
  <li>Use a mindfulness app (guided meditation).</li>
  <li>Count floor/ceiling tiles.</li>
  <li>Slowly trace your hand on a sheet of paper and notice every moment and feeling.</li>
      </ul></div>

   <div class = "b">Mindfulness is ultimately part of DBT which is <b> Dialectical Behavior Therapy</b>. DBT includes many skills on how to manage emotions and your personal relationships.

   <center><div class = "c">Mindfulness is important to me because not only does it help me with my disability but it helps to keep me in the moment. Somtimes in life we can 'zone out' and life just flies by without us realizing. Sometimes I just like to stop and 'smell the roses' in a sense. I enjoy fully absorbing the moment and paying attention to what's going on around me.</div>
<br>
<br>
   </center>
   <center><p class = "b"> Mindfulness and DBT in general have helped with many aspects of my life and I highly recommend reading about the various skills and practicing. Even just practicing mindfulness every once in a while is helpful for your mental health. </p> </center>
