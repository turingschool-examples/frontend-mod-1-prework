                              <hr>
                                  <p>This trip into Mt. Evans Wilderness was full of <em>firsts</em>.
                                    This was the first backpacking trip that my younger brother had
                                    ever taken. It was also the first time that he had ever picked
                                    up a fly rod. I set him up with a traditional Ishigaki Kebari fly
                                    on a Tenkara rod, and set him to work drifting the fly through a riffle
                                    in the inlet of the lake. Within a few casts he had his first fish on.
                                    Never had I taught someone to fly fish and seen them be so successful so
                                    quickly. While we were cleaning the fish, I pulled a fresh roe sack out of
                                    a female and popped it in my mouth. My brother's look of intrigue and disgust
                                    was my reward for a job well done (along with the tasty caviar). <img class="" src="" alt="">

                              <hr>
                                  <p>After a long day of deer hunting on an adjacent mountain,
                                    with no sightings and no success, I knew it was time to put down the
                                    musket in exchange for the fishing rod. Right at dusk, as the wind
                                    was picking up, and the temperature was dropping, the fish were starting
                                    their nightly ritual: <b>trolling and feeding</b>. The lure I was tempting
                                    passersby with was irresistible. For the 20 minutes before total darkness
                                    the action was sensational; fish after fish were coming to the hand. The fish caught
                                    in this lake were exclusively Cutbows (Cuthroat+Rainbow trout hybrids). I hadn't
                                    caught Cutbows since I was a kid, and the first glimpse of the fish make me giddy.

                                <h3>South Boulder Creek</h3>
                                <hr>
                                    <p>South Boulder Creek is my go to spot. It's close to the city, and makes for
                                      any easy day trip. The fishing here can be rather hit or miss. Somedays you catch
                                      fish all day long, others days the river seems like a <em>ghost town</em>. On This
                                      particularly gorgeous summer day, the water was alive with the buzzing of hatching
                                      insects. I matched the hatch, and tied a Bluewinged Olive onto my Tenkara rod, waded
                                      half way into the cool streaming free stone river, and cast my line to the opposite side.
                                      Instantly, a (large for that stream) Brown Trout rose and sipped my fly from the surface.
                                      Just like I had written a script, I cast a second time in the same spot that I had caught
                                      the last fish, and another trout rose and ingested my fly. It is rare to catch two fish,
                                      one right after the other in exactly the same way. This catch made for a memorable day.

                                <hr>
                                    <p>This place is a rare gem. Sitting slightly above 11K feet in elevation, the weather
                                      is fickle and temperamental. When the weather allows, and the wind has ceased blowing
                                      for a moment, it's time to get a line wet. This lake is teaming with Brook Trout, and
                                      though they see a lot of pressure during the summer months, they can be fooled and
                                      they can be caught. The trick is to present a fly as delicately and naturally as possible.
                                      This can be incredibly challenging when the cast needs to meet fish feeding 25 yards off the
                                      bank. Brook Trout are naturally very weary fish, so approach cautiously and wear natural
                                      colored clothing.<img src="" alt="">

                  <p><b><em>JOHN WATTERSON</em></b><br>
                    I am a Colorado native, who spends as much time in the woods and on the water as
                    humanly possible. I received my first fly rod at the age of 10, and have been chasing
                    trout ever since. Although I learned how to fish on a traditional western rod, I now
                    fish almost exclusively with a set of <em>Tenkara USA</em> rods. I reside in Denver, with my
                    lovely wife Genevieve and our two loyal canine sidekicks Bruce & Tallulah.
