    <p>Some info on a few of my favorite Toyota platforms</p>
    <p>We'll touch on the following:</p>

    <h2>2JZ</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most <i>legendary</i> item in this article.
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_JZ_engine#2JZ">2JZ</a> is a 3.0 litre inline-6 cylinder engine.
      It came in a variety of models, some with forced induction (turbo), others with variable valve timing (VVT-i).
      All models featured solid/closed-deck cast-iron blocks, with aluminum cylinder-heads. </p>
    <h2>2ZZ</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_ZZ_engine#2ZZ-GE">2ZZ</a>, often referred to as Toyota's "Flagship 4-cylinder". The 2ZZ is a 1.8 litre inline-4 cylinder engine.
      Utilizing the same aluminum block from the 1ZZ, the 2ZZ featured an aluminum cylinder-head designed and manufactured by Yamaha.
      This cylinder head featured "lift" technology, coined by Toyota as VVTL-i. (Variable Valve Timing with Lift).
      The Yamaha head boasts a redline of over 8,000 rpm with the "Lift" kicking in around 6,000 rpm.
      The valves will open a little longer and wider for extra flow, both from the intake and exhaust manifolds. </p>
      <h2>3RZ</h2>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RZ_engine#3RZ">3RZ</a> is another inline 4 cylinder, this time with a cast-iron block and aluminum cylinder head.
      The 3RZ is the <b>beefier</b> version of the 2RZ, boasting a massive 2.7 litres of displacement.
      One of the largest displacements of any 4-cylinder engine on the market.
      <h2>22RE</h2>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_R_engine#22R">22RE</a> is the last inline 4 cylinder on my list. Nothing super special other than incredible reliabilty.
      Most older Toyota pickups were equipped with this 2.4 litre workhorse. This engine, like many others, also featured a cast-iron block and aluminum cylinder-head.
