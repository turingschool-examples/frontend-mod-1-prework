    <h2>Vegetables</h2>
    <p>You can easily grow a small garden to supply you and or friends and
      family nutrient rich, environmentally friendly food that is good for
      your body and mind. A small garden bed can be filled with your favorite
      vegetables. Everyone I know who has started a small garden loves
      it and plans to always have one incorportated into daily life.</p>
    <h2>Medicinal Plants and Herbs</h2>
    <p2>Although food are the prefered plants to grow, medicinal herbs can be
      incorporated into your garden as well. Sage is great for sore throats and
      popular in soups and roasting meat or vegetables. Chamomile is delicous in
      tea for relaxing or as a mild bittering agent for your stomach. Yarrow is
      good for wound coagulaton and a mild antimicrobial. These are some of my
      favorite medicinal plants to grow.</p>
