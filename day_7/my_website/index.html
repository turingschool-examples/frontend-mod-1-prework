    <h1>Historical Fiction</h1>

    <h4>Historical fiction doesn't get enough credit.</h4>

    <p>
      People who love history often look down on historical fiction, but they shouldn't. Let's be clear; historical fiction is not history. I have watched in mild horror as authors (or scriptwriters) put forward complete fantasy 'based on the life of' some historical figure who would not be able to recognize anything that followed; but even that sort of writing serves a purpose that we should support.

      History is important. It tells us about significant events that shape cultures and gives us guidance on how to conduct our own affairs. Everyone should study history; their own, and the history of other countries as well. But history can be really boring. That's where historical fiction comes in.

    <p>It shocked me to learn that many people in Britian did not know about the privation and the inhumane treatment of the Irish during the Potato Famine until it was mentioned on two popular television shows, <i>Downton Abbey</i> and <i>The Crown</i> both dealt briefly with the subject, and many Brits who had thought that the anger of the Irish was over a centuries long occupation suddenly understood the 'Troubles' in a different light. Downton Abbey is hardly factual, but it introduced many people to a subject not covered in British history classes.

      Some historical fiction is extremely well researched. <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Renault target="_blank"> Mary Renault</a> produced well-researched, if not unbiased works about Alexander the Great, and wrote a biography on him as well. <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Hibbert target="_blank">Eleanor Hibbert</a> produced well researched historical fiction and non-fiction under the name Jean Plaidy, and also wrote romance novels loosely based on historical characters under the name of Victoria Holt. Even poorly researched historical fiction serves a purpose. Someone who might never pick up a history book will read these novels, or watch some show based on an historical figure and find themselves intrigued. The stories excite the imagination and the reader wants to know more. What was this person really like, what was life like then and there, and so they do pick up that history book.
