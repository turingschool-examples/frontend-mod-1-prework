    <h1>Fly Fishing in Colorado</h1>

    <h2>Why Learn to Fly Fish?</h2>
    <p>Learning to fly fish may seem overwhelming at first, especially when compared to traditional fishing. There is a lot of gear, new terms and techniques to learn, but the experience is unlike any other and why I tell everyone that they should learn how to fly fish.</p>
    <p>A day out on the river listening and observing what's going on around you is an amazing way to connect with nature. Seeing what changes the day, sunlight, and weather bring and knowing how to respond accordingly is a skill that takes time and patience, but the reward is worth it.</p>

    <h2>What am I Doing?</h2>
    <p>When starting off, I highly recommend attending a Fly Fishing 101 class at a local fly shop. They break down the sport, the setup, and teach you how to cast. It's also a great way to build a relationship at a fly shop, which if you really get into the sport, you will find yourself spending a lot of time (and money) at.</p>
    <p>After that class, spend some time practicing the knots and casts at home or at a local park. It's much easier to practice casting in a large, open area before you hit the water. Once you feel comfortable, find a fishing spot close to home to get out and start fishing. Keep this first trip simple, and try to just focus on the process.</p>
    <p>After spending some time on your own, you should have an idea as to what areas need improvement. I highly suggest hiring a guide. It can be expensive, but you will learn a lot from those who have spent a lot of time on the water.</p>

    <h2>What do I need?</h2>
    <p>It's easy when learning something new to get carried away by the amount of gear you think you need, but when you are first getting started I recommend sticking to the basics and based on your interest you can continue to build from there.</p>
      <h3>Basic Gear:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fly rod</li>
          <li>Fly reel</li>

    <h2>Where do I Fish?</h2>
    <p>Colorado is home to many amazing bodies of water. It's important to do your research ahead of time and make sure the area you are accessing isn't private property. It's also important to make sure you are aware of the flow levels, water temperature, and any potential bans.</p>
    <p>Some great resources to refer to include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reach out to either your local fly shop, or a fly shop in the area you will be fishing in.</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <p>I still consider myself a beginner with a lot to learn. However, I still love talking to others about the joys of fly fishing and sharing with new folks some of the following advice:
      <ul>
        <li>Patience is key.</li>
        <li>Laugh it off!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You will find yourself in a tangled mess more than you think. Laugh it off and move on.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Take a break when you want.</li>
        <li>Find a role model, mentor, or group.</li>
