    <h1>Surviving Your First Festival</h1>

    <h2>So you bought a ticket to your first festival... </h2>
    <p> First, <b>congratulations!</b> I know your bank account is currently weeping and, if you're like me, are all ready stressing over what to wear, but you're finally about to join the ranks of something truly amazing.</p>
    <p>Music festivals can be the most amazing and liberating experiences ever, however, they can also be exhausting if not out of control sometimes. Knowing what to expect and preparing in advance can save you a lot of time and headaches and allow you to focus on what really matters. Through this site I hope to give you a better sense of what to expect, how to prepare yourselves, and most importantly, how to be safe while letting your freak flag fly!</p>

    <h3 class="second-header">The Basics</h3>
    <h4>Find Your People</h4>
    <article>
        <p>As I stated earlier music festivals can be something truly special, this fact is only made greater by those you surround yourself with as you dance your cares away. Not only does it bring better security to go with a friend or two or ten, it also allows you experience something with these special people in your life. Get a great group and make even greater memories.</p>

    <h4>Travel & Lodging</h4>
    <p> Once you have hit submit and received that sweet, sweet confirmation email it's time to move on to the next step in this new journey; Travel and Lodging.</p>
    <article>
        <p>Whether it's driving, busing, or flying figuring out how and when you are getting you and your sick dance moves to your festival is very <b>VERY</b> important. In fact once you have purchased your ticket is great practice for you to book your mode of travel ASAP, as in within the next few days. Costs, especially for airlines, only increase as the date to your show gets closer and closer. If you decide to road trip it with your crew, figure out whose car to take, how to divvy out gas money, what day and time to leave and how many sick playlists you need to make. Trust me, getting these more boring and well, cumbersome things out of the way will allow for you and your friends to focus on getting excited and not stressed as the show approaches.</p>
        <p>Speaking of boring and cumbersome the next step in your planning is figuring out where everyone is going to be staying. For those next three to four days wherever and however you decide to stay will be your new home. Whether that be camping, hotel, or air bnb you'll have to find something that fits everyone's fancy. Just as airline prices, hotels and air bnbs increase <b>alot</b> in price as the festival gets closer and if you're thinking about camping tickets for spaces sell out very quickly. Basically, get on this portion as quickly as you can as well. One other note is to make sure that no matter the option you choose that you and your group have enough room for everyone. Cutting the price in exchange for being cramped and uncomfortable is not worth it, trust me.</p>

    <h3 class="fourth-header"> What to Expect: </h3>

    <div class="definition-list">
        <dl>
            <dt>Shuttles and Lines</dt>
            <dd>Both will be long and take annoying amounts of time to get through. Plan ahead, head in early, and see your anxiety decrease exponential.</dd>
            <dt>Pricey Food and Drinks</dt>
            <dd>Food and drink prices at the festival can and will brake your bank if you're not careful. Pulling out a planed amount of cash for each day will help you stay on budget and help keep you from searching for the always elusive ATMs. On top of this, it's great practice to pack your own food for you room/tent and to eat before hand before venturing inside the festival.</dd>
            <dt>Crowds</dt>
            <dd>Just as you have decided to experience the summer to the fullest, so it seems has half the worlds population. There will be people every which way, especially the closer you get to the front of the stages. If you don't deal well with crowds don't hesitate to hang back on the open spaces around the edges of the stages, which most festivals provide. Also, with crowds comes more opportunities for bad people to do lame things. Make sure that you belongings/ backpacks are secured and tamper proof from behind.</dd>
            <dt>Rest Up</dt>
            <dd>Most festivals will run at least two to three days, some even going into a fourth (<i>Looking at you Electric Forest</i>) so be sure to listen to your body. It's a marathon not a sprint, and your feet and joints will thank you later.</dd>
            <dt>The Great Outdoors</dt>
            <dd>Be sure to check the weather before heading out each day, and even then, it's best to always plan for the unexpected. It can be life saver having sunscreen, a rain jacket, extra layers, or even a hand held fan, and can keep you focused on having fun instead of suffering. Now I'm not saying bring a rain jacket to EDC in the middle of the dessert, just use some logic. </dd>
            <dt>Set Times</dt>
            <dd>As with every festival there will be overlay with artists set times. It's a drag but one you can deal with in stride. First and foremost, make a plan with your group with who everyone wants to see and go from there, making a meet up point if necessary. If you find you have some free time don't be afraid to explore, there is much more to festivals than just the music.</dd>
            <dt>Port-o-Potties</dt>
            <dd>Yes they're smelly, yes they're gross, yes they will run out of hand sanitizer, but you just have to get use to them because they're all ya got. </dd>
