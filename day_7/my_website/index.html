    <p><i>When the temperatures drop and the snow starts to fall, not all of us dream to escape to a white sandy beach.  Let's take advantage of what the cold weather can offer us while traveling in the winter.</i></p>
    <br />
    <h2>Vail, Colorado</h2>

    <p>There are many ski resorts to choose from in Colorado.  They all offer something unique.  Some cater to the rich and famous, some to locals.  Some have great skiing, some great ammenities.  Vail is my personal favorite.  The skiing is phenomenal.  Skip the front side of the mountain and head straight back to the bowls.  That's where the magic happens!</p>

    <p>When traveling to Park City there is something to offer for every outdoor enthusiast.  Of course you can hit the slopes skiing, but you can also go to the olympic village, shop through their towns and find many family friendly activities.  On my most recent trip I went tubing at one of their tubing parks and it was a blast.  They allow you to go just once or go for an entire day.  One time was enough for me, but it was thrilling!</p>

    <p>I traveled to Germany as a high schooler, and saw did the regular tourist things.  I saw old churches, ate bavarian pretzels and I even tried to sneak a beer!  Most memorable of my time there was a trip to the world's largest cuckoo clock.  However, what I have been dying to do is visit the Christmas Markets.  Use the information below to visit your Christmas winter wonderland!</p>

    <h2>Iceland</h2>

    <p>Iceland is not as cold as it sounds, yet continues to provide a once in a lifetime expreience!  It is easiest to center yourself in Reykjavik and venture out from there for activites.  There are lots of things to do, but if you can catch the northern lights you are truly lucky!  Another must is a stop to the blue lagoon.  It is located in a lava field near Grindavik and is a show stopper!</p>

    <p>Whistler is a world class land of winter fun!  Located less than two hours outside of Vancouver, it is an ideal place for locals and tourists to flock to.  It has a lovely ski village, winter ziplining, and snowshoeing to name just a few activites, but make sure to stop by the olympic village.  The olympics were hosted in Vancouver/Whistler in 2010 and the rings are still standing.  Make sure to stop by for a photo!</p>
