       <h3 id="intro1">What is a Keystone?</h3>
        <p>Think of it as a thesis. They can take nearly any form; students have written novels, done scientific lab research, done scientific field research, made ceramic installations, etc. Most write an academic paper of some sort. The connecting thread is that they must be academically rigorous and produce some sort of final product. They must also connect to the student's major.</p>

        <p>My Keystone was inspired by two nineteenth-century travel books I encountered while doing my experiential learning at the Denver Public Library Western History and Genealogy Department. For my experiential learning, I worked with about 100 unlabeled wood, copper, and zinc printing plates, that were from these books: <cite>Over the Range to the Golden Gate</cite> and <cite>The Crest of the Continent</cite>, by Stanley Wood and Ernest Ingersoll, respectively. My job was to identify the plates and create a detailed inventory for that particular collection.</p>
        <p>For my Keystone, I followed parts of both of the routes of these travel books on a road trip to investigate how and why things have changed in the American West since they lived, just over a century ago. These books are part of the genre of railroad promotion, basically intended to get people on trains. In particular, these two were published by R. R. Donnelley & Co. and both edited by Shadrack K. Hooper. Although these two books were not, as far as I can tell, hugely influential (especially <cite>Over the Range</cite>) they provide a representative sample of their moment in history.</p>
        <p>The trip I went on took nineteen days. I traveled from May 6<sup>th</sup> to May 24<sup>th</sup> of last year. The route I took mostly followed <cite>Over the Range</cite>, as <cite>Crest of the Continent</cite> focuses almost entirely on Colorado. The route is marked with the green line on the map. I traveled with members of my family, because I did not want to do it alone and their schedules lined up. I am grateful for their help and support along the way, especially because they did most of the driving. I plotted the route for my own benefit while writing my Keystone on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KcKHjSU2mfOVXV7Wwv9OX4nBtAKG4Xjd" target="_blank">this map</a>, so if you need a better look, feel free to look at it. The link opens in a new tab.</p>
        <p>My guiding question throughout this process was: </p>
        <p><em id="bigquestion">How did we get here?</em></p>
        <p>I was especially interested in the environment and water and transportation infrastructure, although there will not be as much discussion of infrastructure here.</p>

          <figcaption>The section in question is in red.</figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>The section I want to talk about is from about page 80 to 84 of my Keystone. On the fifteenth day of the trip we drove from Los Angeles to Sacramento, and on the following two days we drove from Sacramento to Salt Lake City.</p>
          <p>That’s still a lot of driving, so I’m going to focus a little closer. Anybody who has crossed the Sierra Nevada mountain range east of Sacramento knows that there is a profound difference between the two sides of the mountain range. I’m going to focus on how that difference manifests by looking at two regions, one on either side. I am going to focus on the Central Valley in California and the Great Basin in Nevada.</p>
          <p>The Central Valley is some of the most productive farmland in the entire world. It is heavily irrigated, and serves as a breadbasket for California, the United States, and even the world. The Great Basin is a large inland desert, and every drop of water that falls into it stays within due to its hydrology. Its lakes are mostly saline making irrigation difficult. It’s actually larger than I marked on the map, reaching into Oregon and further south, but the area I am focusing on is Northern Nevada, so I only marked that part for clarity.</p>
          <p>Before delving into analysis, here are two pictures I took on the trip, and already there might be a lot of obvious differences between the two places to the viewer. (Besides weather and transportation infrastructure, of course.) I wanted to show these pictures so anyone who hasn’t been to either place will have some idea of what they look like.</p>

        <h3 id="body2">Central Place Theory</h3>
              <figure id=map>
                <img class="medmap" src="images/CentralValleyTheory.gif" alt="A gif showing cities of decreasing size on a map"/>
              </figure>
            <p>One of the most obvious differences to someone driving through can be understood through central place theory, which basically states that cities exist in a hierarchy of size, based on population. An area can sustain only so many cities of certain sizes, with fewer large cities and more smaller cities. There is a spatial element to it a well, which isn’t as important here. Within those cities and towns, more specialized goods and services will be available in the larger towns. When driving through the Central Valley and Great Basin in sequence, this theory takes an interesting turn. It seems like in Nevada, the whole system moves down a level. If you combined Carson City and Reno, the two largest cities in that part of Nevada, Sacramento would still be larger. That means that there are fewer towns and cities all together in Nevada, and even more ghost towns and nominal places. In other words, finding a hotel becomes significantly more difficult in Nevada.</p>
          <h3>Rain Shadows & Rivers</h3>
            <p>I believe the climate and geography of the whole area are major parts of the reason for this difference. The Sierra Nevada range casts an easterly rain shadow, meaning that the Nevada side gets hardly any rain—and alongside that it has hardly any rivers. Simply put, there is a lot less water in Nevada than in California. And the Central Valley in particular has more water because it is heavily irrigated, and the Great Basin is not. California, and Los Angeles in particular, have a long history of using their political power to wrangle water away from other Western states. California’s political power has been a major factor in its productivity, because it has managed to gain access to water from outside its borders and use that for its agriculture, industries, and cities. What that means for these two places, is that the Great Basin simply cannot sustain the amount of industry and agriculture that the Central Valley can sustain.</p>

          <h3 id="body3">Back to <cite>Over the Range</cite></h3>
            <p>I went from thinking about why these places are different to what that means for them. One other difference between these two areas can help us understand the meaning. The difference is how they are perceived. During the trip I often relied almost entirely on a book from 1904 to tell me what to expect from a place. As you can imagine, sometimes it was shockingly different. Sometimes it wasn’t, and that’s what I want to talk about. While we were in the Great Basin, I remember thinking a lot about Stanley Wood’s description of the area, especially the area just west of Winnemucca. I will point out the key phrases.</p>
              <blockquote>We have now fairly entered upon the Nevada Desert, which we shall travel over to the westward until Wadsworth is reached, a distance of 135 miles. This stretch of country is the <strong>most desolate</strong> and the <strong>most uninteresting</strong> of any of the deserts crossed on the transcontinental journey. It is characterized by an almost <strong>total absence of vegetation</strong> of any kind, and by a remarkable distribution of scoria, the remains of extinct volcanic action. These deposits of black lava are scattered over a grayish expanse of sand, and are of general cubical form, varying in size from that of a pea to that of a good-sized house. (152, emphasis mine)</blockquote>
            <p>He does not describe the Central Valley in one individual paragraph, but he does describe its southerly portion—the San Joaquin Valley—as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>After crossing the San Joaquin River and turning to the right, our course is up the famous San Joaquin Valley—the <strong>great granary</strong> of California. Here are five million acres of the <strong>best wheat land</strong> in the world. A valley two hundred miles long by thirty miles broad, which when <strong>vivified by the magic touch of irrigation</strong>, produces not only wheat but also almost everything that can be raised in tropical or temperate zones—wheat, corn, oats, flax, apples, oranges, lemons, figs, nuts, olives—the list is too extended for recapitulation. Properly conserved there is <strong>water enough to irrigate the whole valley</strong>, and in many places the natural supply of water has been supplemented by that flowing from artesian wells.(181-182, emphasis mine)</blockquote>
            <p>We can extrapolate from those key phrases to see what Wood values in a place, and that generally can be summed up in two words: plants and productivity. And if we extrapolate that even further, we get a pretty clear picture of which <em>place</em> Wood values. The Central Valley, not the Great Basin.</p>
            <p>It might seem like it’s not a big deal that Wood doesn’t like Nevada. He lived over 100 years ago and his book didn’t sell that many copies. But his words matter, because people like him and Ingersoll, who wrote the other book, in a sense created the West; they helped create what we think of it—at the paradigmatic time just after the first transcontinental railroad had been completed. That meant more people were going West, and there was more incentive to sell it. That is exactly what these books did. They sold the West, not as-is, but as a romantic, edenic West.</p>
              <figure id=map>
                <img class="smallmap" src="images/Tahoe.JPG" alt="A view of Lake Tahoe through trees from the road"/>
                <figcaption>Approaching Tahoe.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>But when one of these books—which were, again, intended to get people to the places they described—calls a place “boring” what does that mean for the place? Wood essentially tells his readers not to value the Great Basin, but he does tell them to value the Central Valley. And why? Because one is “productive.” But this puts these places into a value system that means we value “productivity” over any value the Great Basin might bring us simply by existing. That, of course, assuming that a place has to give us something to matter. You might argue that Wood is saying we should value the Great Basin for its lava rocks, but I would argue he doesn’t, in part because of his description of another place that may seem “unproductive” on the surface: Lake Tahoe, which sits on the California-Nevada border. <br /> Wood describes Lake Tahoe as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>Lake Tahoe, one of the <strong>most beautiful</strong> mountain lakes in the world, lies in the heart of the Sierras, 6,280 feet above the sea, while mountain peaks surround it, rising to an additional height of from two to four thousand feet. It is 23 miles in length, 13 miles in breadth, and from 100 to 1,800 feet in depth. Its waters are famous the world over for their <strong>crystal purity</strong>, and their transparency is so absolute that fish, which abound in great numbers, can be seen distinctly as they swim beneath you, at a distance of eighty feet. On its <strong>lovely shores</strong> are situated some of the <strong>most delightful</strong> summer resorts. The mid-summer air is <strong>cool and invigorating</strong>, the hunting and fishing <strong>excellent</strong>, and the landscape <strong>picturesque</strong> and a <strong>never-ending delight to the eye</strong>. (156, emphasis mine)</blockquote>
            <p>Here the picture is more complicated. Much of his description hinges on Tahoe’s natural beauty. But again, Wood values productive, <em>useful</em> nature, although here its uses include delight. Tahoe’s uses, to Wood, are not simply agriculture or logging. His description of Tahoe shows how even a beautiful place had to be useful to matter. That use didn’t have to be agriculture or industry, either. It could be fishing, or hunting, or selling train tickets to get people to resorts.</p>

        <h3 id="body4">Consequences</h3>
            <p>Nevada was, after all, the site of nuclear testing. Not the Central Valley, and definitely not Tahoe. And Nevada was chosen in part because of the perception Wood perpetuated: that Nevada, and the Great Basin, are wastelands—not useful, and not beautiful. The stories we tell about the places we live influence how we might interact with them, and it’s important to think more critically about those stories as our climate changes.</p>
            <p>It’s not like these changes are in the future. At this very moment, irrigation is salinating the soil of the Central Valley and the entire West is drying out and heating up. Euroamerican civilization in the West and the world has done a pretty decent job of ignoring nature as long as it’s convenient or “unproductive.” That’s not a mistake we can continue to make. Our language is a key to rethinking our future. The current settlement patterns in the West have only been around for a few hundred year; farmers in the Central Valley nearly drained the natural artesian wells that Wood told us could irrigate the whole valley if properly conserved in <em>thirty years</em>. I went into this project thinking I was going to mostly wonder about my guiding question: how did we get here? Instead, I’ve spent a lot more time worrying about another question:</p>
