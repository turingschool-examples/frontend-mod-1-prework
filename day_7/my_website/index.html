  <h1>MOVE YOURSELF!<br>
    THE BODY IS DESIGNED FOR<br>
    MOVEMENT</h1>
    <p><i>"The way you use yourself is the way you react with your entire being
      in every situation of your life.
    In some situations you react well, with efficiency, intelligence and
    vitality. In other situations you react less
    well. Whether you react well or not, your whole being is present in all of
    your reactions. And your body - from head to toe - is inseperable from the
    thinking that animates it.
    Therefore, what you think affects your body, and what you do with your body,
    affects your thinking."
    ~Eric Franklin</i></p>

   <h2><center><strong>JUST BREATHE A LITTLE</strong></center></h2>
    <div id="kundaliniyoga">
        An uplifting blend of spiritual and physical practices,
        Kundalini Yoga incorporates movement,<br />
        dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras,
        such as Sat Nam, meaning "truth is my identity."<br />
        The goal is to build physical vitality, awaken spiritual
        thoughts and increase consciousness. It increases body<br />
        strength, promotes overall physical fitness and aids in
        fighting emotional stress by balancing<br />
        the endocrine and nervous systems of the body. As the
        "yoga of awareness,"<br />
        the philosophical purpose of Kundalini is to awaken your
        Higher Self.
        <br />
        Each individual, it is believed, is an energy
        center<br />
        for Brahman (God-like creative consciousness).

  <br />
    <div id="alextechnique">
      The Alexander Technique is a way of learning to move mindfully
      through life. The Alexander process shines a light on inefficient
      habits of movement and patterns of accumulated tension, which
      interferes with our innate ability to move easily and according
      to how we are designed. It’s a simple yet powerful approach that
      offers the opportunity to take charge of one’s own learning and
      healing process, because it’s not a series of passive treatments
      but an active exploration that changes the way one thinks and
      responds in activity. It helps a person discover a new balance in
      the body by releasing unnecessary tension. It can be applied to
      sitting, lying down, standing, walking, lifting, and other daily
      activities.
