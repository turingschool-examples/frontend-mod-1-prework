    <h1>LANE HUNTER</h1>
    <h3 class = "subtitle">Creative Wizard</h3>
    <p class = "p1">
    My identity is tightly wrapped around the 'artist' archetype. Everything I do, every word I say, every iota of my existence is fueled by a <b>need</b> to be creative. I've mostly specialized in illustration and animation. I really enjoy imbuing my art with humor and capturing unique aethetics. I'd like to show some of my work to give you an idea.</p>

      <p class = "p2">This was my first experiment with using a tool in Adobe After Effects called "Rubberhose." This tool allows you to create limbs and adjust the way they react to movement. This little guy is breaking a heavy sweat swinging them hips around and around and around...</p>
