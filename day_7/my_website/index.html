  <p class="intro">I like to put myself in the world where I can do anything.  Whether it is from slaying monsters to farming tomatoes in my farm, videos games allows me to fulfill any interest I have without leaving the comfort of my home.  With normal life of work and personal responsibilities, video games allows me to relax when I have the free time.  Video games can be addicting, but it is something that help me relax from the daily life of stress.</p>

  <p class="likes">There are many types of game genre I like to play and the main genre I like is role-playing games.  I like to put myself in a role-playing character like a mage, swordsman, wizards, or any characters that we would never see in the real world.  With role-playing games, there are many hours needed to be played to make a character stronger.  This is called the grind where a character repeat many tasks in order to level-up or improve skills.  This can be tedious, but it give me a sense of fulfillment when I create a perfect character that can accomplish any quest or goals.</p>
