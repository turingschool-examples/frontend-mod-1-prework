  <h1>In Supermarionation!</h1>
<div class="intro"
  <p>In the 1960s, puppet action-adventure television was all the rage. It was something nobody knew they wanted, but people just couldn't get enough!
     Gerry Anderson, and his talented team, created several groundbreaking series throughout the sixties that revolutionized children's television.
     The care and effort that went into the production of these series has turned them into a fascinating cultural object. Here are a few of my personal favorites!

    <br> <p>Supercar was a show about a super... car. The main characters were Supercar's inventors Professor Popkiss and Doctor Beaker, Mike Mercury (test pilot), an annoying kid named Jimmy, and an even more annoying monkey named Mitch.

    <br><p>Fireball XL5 was a space themed showed, following the adventures of Steve Zodiac of the World Space Patrol. He was joined by Doctor Venus, Professor Matic and a transparent robot named Robert.

    <br><p>Stingray is probably my favorite Supermarionation show. It stars Troy Tempest, the mermaid Marina, and the rest of the crew of the submarine Stingray. They do rescue and research missions for the World Aquatic Security Patrol.

    <br><p>Thunderbirds is the most famous of the Supermarionation series. Former astronaut Jeff Tracy has a secret island and a dead wife. He also has five amazing sons who pilot the inventions of "Brains" and go on rescue missions around the world. There's also undercover spy stuff, with Secret Agent Lady Penelope and her butler Parker.
