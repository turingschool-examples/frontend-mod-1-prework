      <h2 id="about">History</h2>
      <p>
        The Sims franchise was created in 2000 by Will Wright. He created the
        franchise partly to show the dangers of consumerism and how accumulating
        more stuff will not make people happy. For instance, in the Sims
        electronics can break constantly. While not having a dishwasher,
        laptop, or high-definition television set can be inconvenient,
        once a Sim has accumulated enough wealth to buy these items, they must
        constantly fix and maintain them.

      <p>
        The first Sims game was released in 2000. Will Wright came up with the
        idea for the game after losing all of his possessions in a fire.
        In the first Sims game, all of the Sims lived in a small town near
        SimCity, a video game franchise that is the predecessor to the Sims 4.
        SimCity was also created by Will Wright. By the time development of this
        game ended, there were seven expansion packs.

        The Sims 2 was released in 2004 and the events of the game take place
        25 years after The Sims.

        The Sims 3 was released in the summer of 2009. With it came a new
        feature: <em>open world</em>. In an open world game, the entire game is
        available all at once without loading screens dividing various sections.
        For example, the player could watch as their sims biked to school or
        carpooled to work. (Additionally, while these buildings were still
        <em>rabbitholes</em> - places inside which the player can never see -
        they did exist in this game.) This also made it easier to switch from
        sim to sim within the same active household. However, it also meant that
        it could sometimes take hours for a single game to load.

        The Sims 4 was released in 2014, the fourth iteration of the Sims
        franchise. At inital release, the game lacked common staples of the
        franchise such as toddlers, swimming pools, and cars. Toddlers and
        swimming pools were later added to the game in free updates, but many
        users still lament the lack of cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting update to the game has been the addition of multitasking
        and a more complex emotional system than in prior games. For example,
        it's now possible to feel several emotions at once and for these emotions
        to affect how a Sim perceives a particular interaction.

      <h2 id="mods-and-cc">Mods and Custom Content</h2>
      <p>
        Since it's impossible for game developers to create all content that
        people would like to have in a particular game, they often rely on
        users themselves to create mods and custom content that meet this need.
        <em>Mods</em> are scripts that change important elements of the game.
        For example, the popular mod <a href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/"
        target="_blank">MC Command Center</a> adds story progression, which
        affects the lives of non-player characters. For instance, this mod
        can further an NPC's career, marry them, and give them offspring,
        all while the player continues playing their active household.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Custom content</em> is made up of non-script elements that
        volunteers create in order to edit the game. For example, someone might
        recolor a shirt that was created by EA for use in the game - this would
        make more color options available. Most custom content is created using
        the 3D software Blender.
