<p>My name is Lauren. I breathe just like you and every other living being on our planet.
Our breath is our life force.
<em>Mindful breathing</em> is a mindfulness practice that anyone can make time for.</p>
<p> With regular practice, you may notice you are thinking more clearly and have more energy. You might find yourself feeling a greater sense of calm, peace and presence.</p>
<p>I invite you to try this mindful breathing practice at least once a day.
It only takes a minute and can be done anywhere.
Try it when you first wake up or before you go to sleep.
Try it while you are waiting in line or commuting.
Try it instead of checking your phone when you're bored.
Try it if you are happy, sad, mad or scared.
Just try it and see what comes up for you!</p>
<h3>One-Minute Mindful Breathing Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>To start, notice your breath as it is.</li>
    <li>No need to change your natural breath,
      just observe and accept your breath as it moves in and out of your body. </li>
    <li>Consciously deepen your breath for three deep inhales and three full exhales. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Inhale deeply. Exhale fully.</li>
        <li>Inhale to cultivate peace. Exhale to let go of anything that does not serve you.</li>
        <li>Make the third breath the biggest one you've taken all day.
          Breathe in love for yourself. Breathe out love for others.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Let your breath return to normal. Notice how you feel.</li>
    <li>Give thanks to yourself for practing and your breath for the incredible gift of being alive.</li>
  </ol>

  It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart."</i> -Anonymous</p>
