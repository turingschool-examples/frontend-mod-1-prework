<h1>A Pastry Chef Is Creative.</h1>

<p style="font-family:arial;"> When becoming a pastry chef you must be creative.
    Creativity is hard to come by. You need to be open
    to different flavors, designs, and changes in the food industry.
    You need to welcome basil and red bean flavor, abstract designs (much like
    splattering coulis), and gluten free, vegan, and dairy free options.
    Creativity is a must.

<h2>A Pastry Chef Is Adaptable.</h2>

<p> Adaptability is something a pastry chef must have. You must be able
    to work fast and be concise with your plating, sizes of muffins,
    and texture of your macarons. If a diner comes in and want's a dairy free
    dessert, well that means you need to give them one, but you will already
    have something up your sleeve because you adapted already. This is just a
    pastry chef.

<h3>A Pastry Chef Is Hard Working.</h3>

<hr />
<p style="font-family:georgia;">Hard working is what every pastry chef is. You need to wake up early and
    stay late, but this doesn't phase you. You love the rush. You bake 100
    vanilla cakes everyday, make 3 fillings from scratch, and beat 2 pounds of
    Italian butter cream during the weekdays. Don't even get you started on what
    the weekends look like. All you know is that you are a pastry chef, hard
    working is just what you are.
