    <h2>Family Matters</h2>
    <p class="familyDescription">I cannot begin to speak about anything I am passionate about without mentioning my wife and kids. Everly is my oldest, 4 years old, and Reilly is my youngest, 2 years old. My wife and I have been together for 10 years and she holds the family together.
    I am infinitely happy to watch them grow and equally scared to be leaving them in Las Vegas while I finish the <a href="https://turing.io">Turing</a> program. In the end, though, my wife and I agree it is for the best and for a short time. Hopefully
    I can live somewhere a little nicer by the time they begin school.
    <br /><br />
    Some of my kids favorite things to do lately are:
      <ul>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Keeping their mom and dad up at night</li>
        <li>Being VERY loud</li>
        <li>Riding their bikes</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Music to My Ears</h2>
    <p class="music">Another passion of mine is writing music a poetry. Even when the content is not that good it still provides me an emotional outlet. When I feel stressed I can usually write the anxiety away. There is something unique about music, in my opinion. It can evoke all different types of emotions and it is one thing I really find solace in. I cannot play any instruments, but they do intrigue me. I mostly write lyrics, and I almost never perform anything for anyone but close friends and family. It is enough though to have the ability to vent when I feel frustrated or sad or even happy.
