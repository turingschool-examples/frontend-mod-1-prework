          <p>My grandmother makes a flank steak that is EPIC. When I turned 38 she asked what I wanted for my birthday, and truly the only thing I could think was that steak. She just serves hers alone but when I make it I put it in tacos-- another fav food of mine. Here's the recipe that I've found <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/ancho-chile-flank-steak-sweet-potato-tacos">sheet pan steak tacos</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ingredients">
          <ul>
            <li>2 lb. flank steak</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. plus one tsp. ground cumin, divided</li>
            <li>4 tsp salt divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2  lb. fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. sweet potatos, peeled and cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>Corn tortillas, sour cream, and cilantro</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <ol class="directions">
          <li>Place flank steak in a large zip-top plastic freezer bag. Stir together lime juice, next 2 ingredients, 1 Tbsp. cumin, 1 Tbsp. ancho chile powder, and 2 tsp. kosher salt in a small bowl. Whisk in 1/4 cup olive oil, and pour over flank steak. Seal bag, and turn to coat. Chill 1 to 12 hours.</li>
          <li>Place oven rack about 6 inches from top of oven. Preheat oven to 450°. Rinse tomatillos, and cut into quarters. Stir together sweet potatoes, red onion, tomatillos, and remaining 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. ancho chile powder, 2 tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl.
          Spread sweet potato mixture in an even layer in a heavy-duty aluminum foil-lined sheet pan.</li>
          <li>Bake at 450° for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and move sweet potato mixture to outer edges of pan. Place flank steak in center of pan. Increase oven temperature to broil.</li>
          <li>Broil 6 minutes. Turn steak over, and broil 6 minutes more. (Stir vegetables if they begin to char.) Remove from oven, and let stand 5 minutes. Cut steak across the grain, and drizzle with pan drippings. Serve with sweet potato mixture, tortillas, sour cream, and fresh cilantro.</li>

        <div class="recipe_intro">
          <p>Coming from a landlocked state my exposure to dishes comprised of sea creatures was minimal at best, thus my palate never quite developed a liking for the briney tatse. My wife however grew up in Houston, and her family has a bay house in Galveston. She grew up eating fish that she herself pulled out of muddy bay waters... and liked it. Eating fishy tasting crustaceans is as common place for her as eating rocky mountain oysters is for me. One of my first visits to Galviston I tried jambalaya from a trailer on the side of the highway that runs along the beach. My mouth was not ready for minerally iron taste that overwhelmed it; I was turned off. It's taken many years of dipping my toes in the eating-seafood pool to figure out what I like and what I really don't. This recipe from Southern Living checks the like box.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ingredients">
          <ul>
