          <p>I'm a big fan of chia seeds for one simple reason, not that they
            are a great source for fatty acids, antioxidants, fiber, iron, and
            calcium. No no, it's that I like to squish them through my teeth into
            my cheecks. Jello was a favorite dessert of mine and as a kid I'd
            take a big bite, clench my jaw and push the cubes through the cracks
            in my teeth. Surely you all remember doing that too right.....right?
            Well, when I eat chia I'm back to pushing jello through my teeth only without the red dye 40, gelatin, and crazy amounts of sugar. Not to mention this is one of my wife's favorites, these little guys can be made the night before and are super easy. She found it flipping through one of our many <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237680/chia-seed-pudding/">allrecipes magazines</a>.</p>

        <div class="recipe_intro">
          <p>I've flirted with eating GF for many years, I'd be pretty good about it for a while and then one day a savory scone would get the better of me. I'd tell myself "you'll just have this little bit that fell off the edge". But telling myself these things was a slippery slope, as by the end of the week I'd be cutting an entire scone in half and making a mac and cheese sandwich out of it. My latest attempt at going GF has been more succseful; I know my triggers so I knew I needed to find a decent scone recipe. Note - I don't live in some make believe world were I think someday I'll find a gluten substitute that will be as good as the real thing, I know I won't. But when I want something that's pretty darn close I make these from <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/best-ever-gluten-free-scones-50121233"></a>epicurious.</p>

        <div class="recipe_intro">
          <p>One of the great joys of ordering delivery Chinese food is the amount of food that will arrive at your door in 30 to 45 min. I'm always amazed at the amount of food I can pack away when I eat Chinese. There's a nasty rumor out there that says it's because of the MSG which stops telling your brain when you're full and should stop eating. That or I simply cannot control myself when I comes to that wonderful umami flavor explosion. Either way it's a problem, and I often feel so full I quickly slip into food comma and can't really remember the rest of the night. One very rare morning we had a carton of left over rice. Craving fried rice I did a quick search for breakfast Chinese because, apparently I didn't get enough the night before. I found this gem at <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/breakfast-egg-fried-rice/">My Korean Kitchen</a>.</p>
