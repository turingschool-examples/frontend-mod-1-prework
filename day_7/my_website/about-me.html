      <p>I'm a Florida native but no stranger to Colorado. I've lived out here
        for seasonal work at ski and rafting companies and also kicked off my
        career in Boulder. I've been working in public relations for brands in
        the outdoor industry for the past four years, but it's time for a change!
        I'm excited to reroute and take on the new challenge of software
        development. Besides the excitement of bringing ideas to life and
        creating solutions to problems through websites and apps, I'm excited by
        the prospect of being able to find a job anywhere and have remote
        capability for travelâ€”a major passion of mine.
