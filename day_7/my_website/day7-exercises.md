## Psychology
* How does this make them feel?
  * Bad Example: http://www.gsalazar.cnc.net/. Makes the user feel like the business is unprofessional and not legitimate.
  * Good Example: https://www.denverspanishnetwork.com/. Makes the user feel like their business is well rounded and legitimate, can book classes online for example.

## Usability
* Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
    * Bad Example: https://www.schompmazda.com/. Trying so hard to look like an advertisement when you probably just want to see their inventory of cars.
    * Good Example: https://www.davidsonsmotors.com/. 2 Locations, View inventory of each under them.

## Design
* Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
  * Bad Example: http://www.theprotectionsource.com/. User has to read an entire paragraph to figure out what the business does and it's still not clear.
  * Good Example: https://mhelectricaldenver.com/. Picture's say 1000 words and it makes the intentions clear from the start.

## Copywriting
* Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
  * Bad Example: https://www.allmysons.com/ Good design flow, but in order to get any information you must put your email in to get an extra information.
  * Good Example: http://takemehomemoving.com/ Offers estimates, about, buy materials, gallery and contact all on the top bar.

## Analysis
* Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
  * Bad Example: https://www.heating-ac.com/home.html Gives no answers to common problems, doesn't make it clear where you would find answers.
  * Good Example: https://www.nowha.com/furnace-repair. Gives clear 4 options to commonly held HVAC problems.
