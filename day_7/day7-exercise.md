<h1>Psychology</h1>
How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?<br />
<br />
 https://www.netflix.com/ The user is presented with a lot of options at once and the site is all inclusive.
https://thepiratebay.org/ You must search for your content, download a 3rd party torrent software, choose the torrent you wish to download, make sure the link works, and wait for the download.

<h2>Usability</h2>
Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever? <br />
<br />
https://www.stmarytx.edu/academics/set/ Clearly laid out site with programs to choose from and a large banner menu
https://www.uat.edu/ this website has too many moving parts and pages, could be hard to read for people with eyesight problems. Also the page can take a long time to load.

<h3>Design</h3>
Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?<br />
<br />
https://art.utexas.edu/ Clear easy to understand, easy to navigate
http://art.yale.edu/ Cluttered, unpleasant to look at, not what you'd expect from an art school.

<h4>Copywriting</h4>
Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want? <br />
<br />
Of course want the user to complete their goal! Thats the point of UX.
https://www.amazon.com/ Users simply search for the item they want and choose between new and used.
https://craigslist.org/ Users must select their location, browse for a deal, contact the seller and possibly physically travel to receive their item. All things that make it less likely for a consumer to buy something/use craigslist.

<h5>Analysis</h5>
Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?<br />
<br />
