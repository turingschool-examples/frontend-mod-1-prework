The 5 Main Ingredients of UX:

Psychology

    How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

      Bad example- https://www.pennyjuice.com/
        This site has no navigation buttons or menu. You have to scroll down to
        get to anything.
      Good example-  https://www.brooksrunning.com/
        This site has really easy to follow navigation. I can very easily get
        to women's shoes or sports bras without jumping through a bunch of
        hoops.


Usability


    Are there any user mistakes you could prevent?

      Bad example- https://www.paradisewater.com/
        This website is a mess to navigate, it's difficult to find where to
        order things, and even more complicated to order (and it's unlikely
        you'll order what you actually need without making numerous mistakes).
      Good example- https://www.amazon.com/
        I think Amazon is pretty easy to navigate and checkout is pretty easy
        too. There is a ton of information but it never feels overwhelming
        and it's very easy to check out.

Design


    Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?

      Bad example- https://wegieldrzewny.pl/
        Many things on this site look clickable or are in line with clickable
        things, yet when you click on them nothing happens.
      Good example-  https://www.rei.com/
        Everything on this site that looks clickable, is clickable. It's
        pretty easy to navigate, especially when you consider the sheer
        amount of stuff they carry.

Copywriting


    Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

      Bad example- http://www.bellads.info
        There's way too much going on here. I'm overwhelmed and not sure where
        to go or what to do.
      Good example- https://www.google.com/
        Google is one of the simplest, easiest sites to use. It's very simple
        and functionality is fantastic.



Analysis

I think this was the most difficult question to find an example for-
I think of analysis as being a behind the scenes element, so I'm not
really sure how to identify that as a user, so I am making assumptions on
how these sites utilize their data.

    Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?

      Bad example- Instagram.com
        They are constantly updating things, taking away features people love,
        and putting out features no one asked for. I'm not sure they are
        listening to or correctly interpreting user data/feedback. (I mean,
        people have been begging for a chronological timeline every since They
        took it away). At the very least, I think these decisions are driven by
        revenue goals rather than providing a good user experience.
      Good example-  OkCupid.com
        OkCupid is a website that has been around forever. They've always
        compiled huge amounts of data from users, and I think in general they
        make tweaks based on that data and customer feedback. A lot of female
        users stopped using the site because they were harassed by other users
        or simply felt overwhelmed by the number of messages they received.
        OkCupid took metrics and feedback to implement changes to their site
        in oder to make it a better experience for those users.
