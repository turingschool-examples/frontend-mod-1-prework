1. Psychology:
*How does this make them feel?*
Violates: Craigslist (https://denver.craigslist.org/)
The Craigslist homepage can make a user feel very overwhelmed and anxious. The format and colors are extremely unwelcoming, and overall it can be difficult to figure out which categories to click to get to the place you want.

Supports: Cyclebar (https://www.cyclebar.com/)
The Cyclebar homepage immediately gets you excited to work out, and your eye goes directly to the 'Find a studio' link, which is like where the majority of users want to go. This ease makes the user feel good and elimates any potential frustration.

2. Usability
*Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?*
Violates: Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep)
Wikipedia pages are known for being difficult to navigate and easily find the information you are looking for. You have to dig through paragraphs of text to potentially find the piece of information you want.

Supports: Southwest (https://www.southwest.com/)
Southwest's homepage easily shows what we would assume 99% of users are looking for when they visit it. Without even having to scroll, you can put in the flight information you are looking for and click search.

3. Design
*Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?*
Violates: Netflix (https://www.netflix.com/browse)
While the clickable items are across the top on Netflix's homepage after you sign in, nothing happens when you hover your mouse over them, which doesn't make it extremely obvious that you are able to click on those items. You have to click on the magnifying glass icon to get the search bar to pop up, which is making a huge assumption that the user will know that icon signifies searching.

Supports: University of Virginia (https://www.virginia.edu/)
The bar of items you can click on is very clearly separated at the top of the page. The items that have drop downs have the + symbol next to them. And when you hover over each word it turns orange, signifying that you can click on it.

4. Copywriting
*Does it reduce anxiety?*
Violates: CNN (https://www.cnn.com/?refresh=1)
The CNN home page can produce some anxiety (even more than a normal news site) because it is very cluttered. There isn't a clear indication of any types of categories for articles, as it's mostly just sections with names of the articles listed in a row.

Supports: Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/)
I think the Washington Post does a much better job of sectioning their articles by category. They have a heading for articles about the Impeachment Inquiry and the Nationals World Series Parade, as well as a section on the right that lists the top articles.

5. Analysis
*Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?*
Violates: Lowe's (https://www.lowes.com/)
I have never shopped online from Lowe's before, yet when I went to their website there was a whole line of recommended searches for me (ceiling fans, exterior doors, etc.), which means they are making an assumption about my behavior without actually doing any analysis on it.

Supports: Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/)
Amazon does a great job of recommending similar products to those that user has recently viewed.
