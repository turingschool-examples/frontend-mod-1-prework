##### Psychology
<br> How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
- Bad: www.mixbook.com <br>
When you get to mixbook's landing page, you have to first close out of an email marketing sign up pop up. Then, you click to navigate to your desired product (let's say a photo book). You're given a lot of theme options, which is nice. But when you click on one to start making your book, you have to create an account first. I think it would be more effective to let users create a book, install some sort of short-term guest autosave feature, and then ask them to create an account when they check out (but allow them to check out as guest if preferred). I know many people won't create new accounts on websites, especially in scenarios like this where they can't even play around with the design software without signing up. I've also used this service to print photo books and found the software cumbersome and confusing. Feature that should be automated, like snapping a photo into a frame, must be done manually. It requires a lot of effort to design even a simple photo book.

Shutterfly also has an email marketing add that you must click out of to continue. Navigating to the book designing page is similar to Mixbook. However, you are not required to create an account to start making your photo book. While working on the book, a pop up does recommend making an account to save your work, but it's not required. This makes it so the user can create their product (or check to see if the software can even handle what they want to do) without the hassle of making an account. To check out, you must create an account (so the business still meets their goal of getting people signed on for marketing emails), but at this point the user has already committed to buying the product and is much more likely to follow through.
##### Usability
<br> Are there user mistakes you could prevent?
- Bad: dpsjobboard.dpsk12.org <br>
The Denver Public Schools job board has really painful usability, especially in terms of mistakes that are preventable. There are a ton of jobs listed, so naturally the user will want to filter based on what they are looking for. However, the filter is based on user input keywords instead of a drop-down list or check boxes. When I was searching for jobs as an English teacher last year, I didn't know if the keyword should be "English," "Language Arts," "ELA," or something else. It took a lot of trial and error because "English" would pull up English language classes (for speakers of other languages). Additionally, the grades and sub-category filters can contradict each other, which is confusing. For example, my results would vary if I selected grades 6-12 for "Grades" and the "6-12" sub-category versus only selecting one or the other.
- Good: builtincolorado.com <br>
On the other hand, builtincolorado has great usability with little room for errors in their job search function. It's easy to navigate to (much snappier than the DPS job board) and has very clear categories with sub-filters below. None of the filters contradict the categories. There is also an option to input a keyword, but it is not the only way to narrow down results by interest, specialty, or industry. The filter options will also disappear if the category you selected has no jobs with that filter, making it even easier to minimize wasted time.
##### Design
<br> Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
- Bad: craigslist.org <br>
When you go to craigslist, you are greeted by what feels like hundreds of links, all the same size, font, and color. There are some categories, like "community" and "housing," but everything is cluttered together and hard to find, especially for users unfamiliar with the site. The site is also not responsive and does not adjust to my larger screen, leaving a ton of wasted white space on all sides of a small rectangle filled with information. The only bit of help we get is that "create a posting" is highlighted in a very soft yellow, so at least that is easier to find if that is what you came to do.
- Good: mybillie.com <br>
I really like the modern but playful design of this website. They have a clear brand image that is consistent throughout the site and it's very easy to navigate. What makes it so easy to navigate is that the design leads the user's eyes to the next step through the use of color blocks and minimal extra elements. When you visit the website, there is a video that is scaled to take up most of the frame. In the dead center there is their slogan, "Razors built for Womankind." and a big white "Get started - $9" button. The button stands out against the background of the video and, aside from a slim nav bar at the top, it's the only real clickable option unless you scroll down past the video. Even if you scroll down, the "Get started" button is repeated in each section in a bright color. It doesn't feel jarring or out of place, but it is definitely the most eye-catching feature.
#####Copywriting
<br> Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
- Bad: newyearspartydenver.com <br>
The copywriting on this website is sloppy, but especially challenging from a UX perspective. The copywriter was clearly more interested in creating some sort of glamorous image, but the over-the-top descriptions and oddly boastful tone get in the way. So much screen-space is wasted on alienating and cringe-inducing phrases like, "Guests exemplify beauty, intelligence, wit, success, sexiness, wisdom, openness, non-judgement, desire to explore, fearlessness, sophistication, acceptance." When searching for actual information, like what a ticket includes at each level, none can be found. You end up clicking through 12 different links at the bottom only to find repetitive, flowery copywriting that doesn't actually give you any information you need. I would never pay that much for a ticket to an event without knowing specifics, so the unclear copywriting may be detrimental to sales.
- Good: allbirds.com <br>
Allbirds knows that their materials and comfort are what sets them apart as shoe manufacturers, and their copywriting really furthers that message clearly and efficiently. As a brand quickly growing in popularity, many visitors to their page are first-time purchasers. They have a blurb on their landing page that summarizes all the things they want to emphasize about their brand, like materials and ethical production. The blurb is only five short sentences, but they get the point across quickly without losing the reader's attention. Their more writing-heavy pages, like their "Our Materials" page, break up similar punchy blurbs with video, graphics, and photographs. You can easily click to different tabs to get information about the product you want without having to sift through other non-applicable material descriptions.
##### Analysis
<br> Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?
- Bad: nextdoor.com <br>
To be fair, I don't know all the ways that nextdoor uses user data. However, when looking at this specific question, it does seem like they make assumptions about user behavior. If I elect to hide a post, there is no further data collected about why. They do ask for reasons if you report a user, but not for lower-level responses like hiding a comment or muting someone.
- Good: facebook.com <br>
Though ethically questionable, Facebook has clearly refined their analysis process to tailor the user's experience to their individual interests based on click-throughs, website tracking, interactions, and direct feedback. Through this feedback, Facebook asks for users to explain why they've made a choice (so they are not making assumptions about data and behavior) For example, if I select "hide ad" on an advertisement, a pop up asks me why I've elected to hide that ad. Facebook clearly uses negative feedback as much as they use positive feedback to "improve" user experience or reach advertising goals.
