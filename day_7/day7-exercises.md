### What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place?
https://www.google.com - user's motivation is to answer a question/find an article/research something. This is a good answer to the question because there's a big search box right in the middle of the page.

https://spacejam.com - user's motivation is to learn more about movie, find related content - not at all clear what any buttons do, and they're all the same size, implying they're all equally significant.

### Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
https://twitter.com - most everything is where you'd expect it to be (new tweets at the top, search in the top right, other features to the left on the sidebar)

https://www.uat.edu/ - you have to wait for this annoying scroll wheel of icons if you want to look at any of the degrees.

### Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
https://en.wikipedia.org/ - very clear design, has no excessive frills or confusing patterns.

https://www.art.yale.edu/ - this one really speaks for itself, but it boils down to a lack of design and care.

### Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
https://craigslist.org/ - there's a lot of content on the main page and it's a little too overwhelming, but past that, it's a decent website with an alright layout that shows off listings in a clear, large format.

https://www.lingscars.com/ - this perhaps infamous example shows off exactly how not to lay out a site. It's confusing, wild, perhaps fun to look at, but that's not exactly what you want when you're shoopping for a car.

### Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
https://github.com - making a new repo, gist, or project is easy, just click on the plus icon in the top right, where you'd expect it to be.

https://gist.github.com/ - confusingly, however, clicking the plus icon here (in the exact same place) does not give you the same options, and only lets you make new gists. Perhaps useful if that was your intention, but often I find myself on gists wanting to make a repo for whatever reason, and I get confused when clicking the plus icon takes me to a new page instead of opening a dropdown menu.
