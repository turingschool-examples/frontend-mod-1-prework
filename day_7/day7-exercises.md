# User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Answers

### Psychology

* What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place?
  * Supports: [Amazon](www.amazon.com) - When a user goes to Amazon, they're going there to shop and find something they are looking for easily. Amazon does a great job of this by making it easy to find what you're looking for. They've also influenced user behavior by making it the norm to go straight to Amazon when you're looking to purchase something.
* What do they expect when they click this?
  * Violates: [Zara](www.zara.com/us) - At the top of the Zara website is what you think would be a search bar. But, it is actually a link that opens up a different window to search from. This isn't what I would have expected as a user. Also, the search bar gets lost in some of the images.

### Usability

* Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
  * Supports: [Airbnb](www.airbnb.com/) - Airbnb is great about being clear about what the user needs to input. You just simply input where you are going, your check-in and checkout date, how many guests, and your instantly shown results. Easy.
* Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
  * Violates: [Harbor Freight](https://www.harborfreight.com/) - The home page of Harbor Freight includes an overload of products. Products are not easy to find here and can easily be missed. Otherwise, the website's search function works well.

### Design

* Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
  * Supports: [Apple](www.apple.com) - Apple's brand is all about simple, sleek design and their website definitely fits this idea. Their website is simple and sleek, just like their products. It's a unified website that have similar typography and imagery regardless of the tab you're on.
* Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
  * Violates: [PennyJuice](www.pennyjuice.com) - The design of this webpage looks very old and not sophisticated. It makes you question the authority of the page.

### Copywriting

* Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
  * Supports: [Yelp](www.yelp.com) - Yelp uses simple , direct, functional language like, "Write a Review", "Get Directions", and "Add Photo".
* Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what it's about?
  * Violates: [Craigslist](https://denver.craigslist.org/) - There is no text on Craigslist that informs the user as to what the website is about.

### Analysis

* Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
  * Supports: [Facebook](www.facebook.com) - You can conduct social listening on the comments of any company post and conduct research/analytics that way, giving you information and insights into the consumer.
* Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
  * Violates: [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news) - When you click a tab to view news on a different topic, how are results delivered? How can news sites better serve articles? Can they use data to serve up more personalized news content based on likes/dislikes? Is there a better way to organize the news stories, not necessarily to filter anything out?
