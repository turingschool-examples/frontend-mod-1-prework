Good:https://www.espn.com this user is here for sports if he didnt want sports he is in the wrong place.<br />

Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?<br />
Good:https://denver.craigslist.org it has Categories and Subcategories and clear definition of what you will find there
Bad:https://www.dinoballiana.com although it is on purpose for this sit is it not clear or direct and as you sit on the home page it glitches all the time.

Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?<br />
Good:https://www.facebook.com clickable things are either in specific places or diffrent from non clickable things<br />
Bad:http://www.cyberdsignclan.comon the very first page it uses word art as a button then there is more non clickable word art once you get in<br />

Bad:https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-spicers-dancing-with-the-stars-performance-outrages-liberals-as-trump-encourages-support the word news is in the title of this site and I should expect to find objective facts but sadly in this article I don't see a single objective fact to back up its claims <br />
