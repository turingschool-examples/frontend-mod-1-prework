#### What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.

UX is about "doing" the user experience on a site, and to make the site effective for that use while meeting the user and Business goals.  

User Goals are the goals that brought the user to that site/app - if they are able to get what they came for, ie ordering/paying for coffee from the Starbucks site successfully, then that's a successful user experience.

Business goals are about the needs of the business.  Majority of the time, it is about money, for example, Turing has done an excellent job at brand awareness, showcasing its mission, while being successful at enrolling students.  

The 5 Main Ingredients of UX:
Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting & Analysis.


#### After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

I would like to state that <a href="www.spacejam.com">spacejam.com</a> would more than qualify for every violation of these rules, but would have exceeded them in 1996. ;)

1. Psychology

Good: <a href="www.happify.com">happify.com</a>
Very good at stating the mission, defines keywords, shows science, it really makes the user feel good about why they are here.

Violates: <a href="www.theroommovie.com">theroommovie.com</a> this assumes that the user has seen The Room.  If you have, then it makes complete sense, but if not, how it looks doesn't make any sense.

2. Usability

Good: <a href="www.warbyparker.com">warbyparker.com</a> Very easy to get to glasses, to look at specs, to navigate the whole site.

Violates: <a href="www.lowes.com">lowes.com</a> When looking at items, you have to go page by page, no ability to pick page 18 out of 50.  

3. Design

good:<a href="www.zillow.com">zillow.com</a>
Zillow has great design from immediately allowing you to enter in an address, and pulls it up.  From there you are able to easily access neighbors, for sale, rent.  

Violates:
<a href="www.theroommovie.com">theroommovie.com</a>
Can I use this site again?  I mean, the colors, fonts (or rather, font), typeface, gifs, events that will happen in 2012 are listed, multiple broken links.  

4. Copywriting

Good:<a href="www.turbotax.com">turbotax.com</a>
turbotax allows the user to feel very comfortable about going through a very daunting process. It's uses very easy to understand directions and navigation.

Violates:

5. Analysis

Good: <a href="www.fivethirtyeight.com">fivethirtyeight.com</a> data driven by Nielsen measurement to show easy to read graphs & polls that isn't changed depending on a users search history.

Violates:<a href="www.facebook.com">facebook.com</a> Specifically funnels subjected information, uses data for confirmation basis by collecting data on what they "like", follow or search for on facebook.
