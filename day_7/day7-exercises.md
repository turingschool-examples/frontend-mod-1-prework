# Mod 0 Capstone

## DAY 7


## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)

*   There is a great series of UI/UX posts called [UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals](http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals). Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

  * Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your `day7-exercises.md` file.

1.  **Are you thinking of the user's wants and needs, or your own?**
 * Supporting: https://www.msichicago.org/
 * Violation: http://museumofbadart.org/location/ (Specifically: "Open your map settings to configure your "Google Maps API key. The map can't work without it" This is lazy and expects the user to get something as simple as a location of the museum. What bugs me more is that under this location page they have a link to a separate page that has the address on it. Copy paste in google maps would be far more convenient.)

2.  **Are you working with the user's assumptions, or against them?**
 * Supporting: https://www.amazon.com/
 * Violation: http://arngren.net/ (Searched index for boat, first result is a helicopter)
 ---
3.  **Does the site represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?**
 * Supporting: https://www.zillow.com/ (Continued header on all pages.)
 * Violation: https://www.toyandactionfiguremuseum.com/ (Literally a separate index page with a link to the old site, different css style sheet.)
 ---
4.  **Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?**
 * Supporting: https://zero.app/
 * Violation: https://www.uat.edu/ (I do not understand the rotating head objects. They are all portions of studies to persue, however I had a hard time if this needed to be in this catagory or somewhere in #1)

5.  **Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?**
 * Supporting: https://climate.nasa.gov/
 * Violation: https://nwokillers.weebly.com/
