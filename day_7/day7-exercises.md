1. What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place? Reddit.com does great, suzannecollinsbooks.com does not. Suzanne Collins' website feels immediately underwhelming. On the home page there is a sudden, misplaced string of text and quotes below the initial two pictures that also feel out of place. You would expect to find at least a link to purchase books from the site, but you will find no direct links. Reddit exists as a social forum that can be used as a distraction, a tool for finding answers to obscure questions, a news outlet or just a place to have a discussion. All of these aspects are apparent from the home page of the site. The search bar at the top of the page invites you to search the forums and occasionally has surprisingly accurate threads even for what feels like niche topics. Reddit is so good at providing reasons to be there, you may find yourself going down rabbit holes at times.

1. Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)? Amazon.com does great, bellads.info does not. Amazon has such a well categorized site, even with such an immense volume of products and services offered. There are always clear, and sometimes multiple usable paths to get to what you're after. Its even good at getting you to what you were searching for when you're almost correct, you don't have to be exact. Bellads.info has, what is _apparently_ a lot of content to offer, and all of it is crammed onto the home page. It's basically every feature of the site in vomit form across the page, almost enough to drive you away upon arrival. There is no clear path to navigate the site or really a purpose you can discern for the site to exist in the first place.

1. Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately? Apple.com does great, greatdreams.com does not. The first thing you notice upon visiting greatdreams.com is the obnoxious color used as the background for page. The bright color surrounding the black area makes you strain to see the text contained within. Some of the font size is so small that you have to zoom in just to make any of it out. All of the page is centered as well, leaving no real interest as you scroll down the page. Apple keeps everything clean and simple, with pops of attractive color guiding your eyes to their products. With very easy navigation and eye catching advertising for all their newest products, Apple is safely one of the the easier and more pleasant sites to be on when needed.

1. Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not? Sprint.com does great, superior-web-solutions.com does not. Sprint.com is always displaying their current deals and offers in clearly visible large fonts. Giving clear priority to the sales and deals being offered means the site is serving its purpose. In a business where success is getting more customers and having them feel like they got a good deal, this is appropriate advertising. On superior-web-solutions.com, all the text is undersized, leaving the entire page feeling underwhelming. For being a computer based company, one might expect that email would be a readily available form of communication for them, but no email is provided.
1. How can you use this analysis to make improvements? Facebook.com does great, myspace.com does not. Even with all the same advantages that facebook had, myspace never managed to capitalize on their user base like facebook has. Although essentially the same thing, myspace slowly lost users due to lack of interest, and facebook ended up with the users they lost. Being able to figure out what is appealing about your site over what is available on another is the difference in longevity. If you don't analyze the reasons your site is successful and build upon those concepts you leave the door open for someone else to make these improvements. This might lead to your rival capitalizing on the foreground you have set with an initially successful model.
