# What is UX?
- __UX__ is an acronym that stands for ___user experience___.
- The goal of UX and a UX Designer is to make users _effective_.
> UX Design (also sometimes called UXD) involves a process very similar to doing science: we do research to understand the users, we develop ideas to solve the users’ needs — and the needs of the business — and we build and measure those solutions in the real world to see if they work.

## User Goals & Business Goals
### User Goals:
- People are people and they always want something
- People _inherently_ (this is my belief) want to be productive and do productive things

### Business Goals:
> Every organization has a reason for creating a site or app in the first place. Typically it’s money, but it might be brand awareness, or getting new members for a community, etc.

- Business goals or ___metrics___ need to be clearly defined so that the UX design strategy matches the business goal.
> The real test of a UX designer is how well you can align those goals so the business benefits when the user reaches their goal.
<br /> If the goals are not aligned then either users can get what they want without helping the business (lots of users, no success) or the users don’t get what they want (no users, no success).

## The 5 Main Ingredients of UX:
1. __Psychology__
- Users' minds are complex, and they often work with subjective thoughts & feelings
- Deny your ___own___ psychology and ask yourself:
  > - What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?
  > - How does this make them feel?
  > - How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
  > - What habits are created if they do this over and over?
  > - What do they expect when they click this?
  > - Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?
  > - Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?
  > - Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
  > - How are you rewarding good behavior?

2. __Usability__
- "If user psychology is mostly subconscious, usability is mostly conscious."
- There are case when things are fun if they area difficult, like a game. ___Other than that___ things need to be easy and rewarding for users.
- Ask yourself:
  > - Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
  > - Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)
  > - Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
  > - Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
  > - Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
  > - Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
  > - Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
  > - Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?
  > - If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

3. __Design__
- as a UX Designer, our definition of ___design___ is much _less_ artistic than others (I love objective design!)
- Whether you like it is irrelevant
- In UX, design is ___How it Works___ and it can be proven
- Ask yourself:
  > - Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
  > - Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
  > - Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
  > - Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
  > - Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?
  > - Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?


4. __Copywriting__
- "There is a huge difference between writing __brand copy (text)__ and writing __UX copy__. Brand copy supports the image of the company. UX copy _gets shit done_ as directly and simply as possible."
- Ask yourself:
  > - Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
  > - Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
  > - Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
  > - Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?
  > - Does it reduce anxiety?
  > - Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?


5. __Analysis__
- analysis is the main thing that separates UX designers from others…
- Ask yourself:
  > - Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
  > - Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
  > - Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
  > - Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
  > - Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?
  > - How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
  > - Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
  > - How can you use this analysis to make improvements?

## Website examples:

### Psychology
- How does this make them feel?
#### A website that agrees with:
- https://moxiesozo.com/
This websiite makes me feel confidence in those who created it, like they will get the job done the first time.
#### A website that violates this principle:
- https://www.uat.edu/
This website makes me feel confused. It seems that these folks don't know the first thing about technology (as their name would suggest).

### Usability
- If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?
#### A website that agrees with:
- https://www.instagram.com/
Instagram is the king of _not reading the fine print_ in fact, if you don't read a single thing, and just look at images you will understand exactly what is going on.
#### A website that violates this principle:
- https://www.pcworld.com/
PC world makes you search through all of its content via small print. Without navigating the small print, you cannot operate the website.

### Design
- Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
#### A website that agrees with:
- https://www.apple.com/
Everything about all of Apple's design makes you trust it immediately. They have been experts at this ever since the advent of their retail locations. No one does it better than them.  
#### A website that violates this principle:
- https://www.art.yale.edu/
The website for a prestigious university's art department leaves users feeling anxious, and with a spinning head. Nothing about this website exudes trust in this establishment.

### Copywriting
- Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?
#### A website that agrees with:
- https://www.bbc.com/
The BBC does a great job of presenting digestible information with a sense of heirarchy.
#### A website that violates this principle:
- http://www.cjbox.net/
My favorite author's website. Unfortunately, if you were not a CJ Box reader previous to visiting this site, you wouldn't have much of a clue of what is going on or how to approach.

### Analysis
- Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
#### A website that agrees with:
- https://medium.com/turingschool/q1-2019-jobs-report-edbe4d8cff96
Turing clearly uses metrics to establish how successful their students are with full transparency. Even if the data is not what they hoped, the still present it to their viewers.
#### A website that violates this principle:
- https://www.census.gov/
ReAding can be found here for why the 2020 census will likely prove wildly inaccurate, by not identifying bad data:
  - https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/08/31/the-2020-census-may-be-wildly-inaccurate-and-it-matters-more-than-you-think/
