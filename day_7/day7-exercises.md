## 1 Psychology
  How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
  - Supports - www.amazon.com - You barely have to do any work to purchase something on Amazon, they even have "one-click" purchases to make the experience even easier!

  - Violates - https://www.health.com/eye-health/best-mascaras-for-sensitive-eyes - there are so many ads, they take up a lot of real estate on the page so you have to scroll so much to get to the recommendations part of the article.

## 2 Usability
  Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
  - Supports - maps.google.com - I think Google Maps is a great example of a website with great usability. If you use it then it will already have your home and work locations listed and you can find information about your commute with as little as 2 clicks.

  - Violates - Almost any online job application violates this rule of usability. They are repetitive, exhausting and needlessly exhaustive. You submit your application and then fill out the same information that was on your resume into their application.

## 3 Design
  Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
  - Supports - Starbuck's phone app is a great example of their design leading the user's eyes to the right places. You know exactly where to click to pay, your rewards are right at the top and they always have a new incentive for you to click on.

  - Violates - denvergov.org - Good luck finding where you can log in on this website! There is so much on each page you feel like you're wading through so many options to get where you need to go.

## 4 Copywriting
  Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
  - Supports - paypal.com - you know right away what the purpose of this website is, you know that you can purchase and send money and are shown this right away in big font.

  - Violates - https://us.audionetwork.com/ - The biggest text when you first visit this website seems like it's asking you to tell your story, but this is actually a stock music website. You might not realize this right away based off the biggest text on the page that you encounter first.

## 5 Analysis
  Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
  - Supports - consumerreports.org - Although I am a member (and have been for years) they recently sent out their members a comprehensive survey asking for feedback, so hopefully they will make some updates to their services and websites. They clearly decided to use analytics to improve their content and UX.

  - Violates - http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/ - This website looks like it has never been updated and was just haphazardly thrown together. Clearly no thought to who is using this website or how easy or hard it is to navigate.
