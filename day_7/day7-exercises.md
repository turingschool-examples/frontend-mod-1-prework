**1.  Psychology:**

- How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

If you have ever searched for political polling you will notice even the most reputable polling sources have websites that are difficult to maneuver.  That being said, some are worse than others.  I found Gallup to _work_ fairly easily in order to find the data I want.  The Reuters webpage is mostly just image links without text.  It is much more difficult to get the information that I want and it takes a longer amount of time to load the content.

**2.  Usability**

- Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

You sure can!  When shopping over the holidays it became clear that the websites that autofill your shipping address, after the initial few characters, are much easier to use because they require less _input_ from the user.  This feature probably allows for better efficiency as well, as users are more likely to make mistakes.

**3.  Design**

- Do users think it looks good?  Do they trust it immediately?

I know nothing about custom gates and fences.  When comparing websites of two different companies offering comparable services, I immediately feel that I can _trust_ one company to design my custom gate and absolutely not trust the other company.  This is based on how the website looks.  You are in the design business after all!

**4.  Copywriting**

- Is it clear, direct, simple and functional?

Medical insurance websites are not exactly know for their ease of use, however, the amount of hoops you have to jump through to get the information that you want on a Medicaid website is overwhelming.  Other medical insurance websites _direct_ you better through the process.

**5.  Analysis**

- How can you use this analysis to make improvements?

Although, Apple has secured their place in the industry, they are one of the few companies that do not use social media.  It is debatable as to whether Apple needs social media, however, social media can be an important tool for feedback.  This feedback can help them improve their various product offerings from hearing more directly from customers.
