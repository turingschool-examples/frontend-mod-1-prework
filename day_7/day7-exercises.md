UI/UX

1. Psychology

    Question: How are you rewarding good behavior?

    Good:  [Habitica](www.habitica.com) rewards users for good behavior by
    moving users to subsequent levels and giving them Gold after completing
    tasks, which can then be used to buy items for their character.

    Bad: [Facebook](www.facebook.com) rewards users for good behavior (using the site regularly) by bombarding them with excessive notifications and badge icons, which can drive some users away.


2. Usability

    Question: Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the userâ€™s intuition? How do you know?

    Good: [Insight Timer](www.insighttimer.com)'s website allows new users to browse freely in order to navigate to areas of interest on the website intuitively.

    Bad: [Instacart](www.instacart.com) is a grocery delivery service. Customers order their groceries online and then local shoppers pick out and buy their groceries for them. While the customer side of the website seems to be intuitive, the shopper side is not. For example, the app automatically divides each order into categories, which are supposed to be mapped out in order of the fastest route. However, this doesn't take into account errors in categorization and also isn't mapped according to the route that most shoppers take at each store. Since there's no way to edit the categories or shift them around, shoppers have to continuously scroll up and down to make sure that they aren't missing any items. Additionally, customers are allowed to mark items as "priority," which pulls them out of a specific category and into a new one marked "Priority." This feels rewarding from the customer side but doesn't change whether an item is in-store and also makes it more difficult for the shopper to locate because it's not grouped with the other items in the same area. This may have seemed like a logical design for the customer but inhibits the work of the shopper.


3. Design

    Question: Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?

    Good: [Headspace](www.headspace.com)'s website includes minimal text. However, the pictures show people listening to headphones and smiling, which explains clearly that using the program should make the user feel calm and happy.

    Bad: [Github](www.github.com) can be very confusing for new users as there are few pictures and illustrations to explain the structure of the website or how to use it.



4. Copywriting

    Question: Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what it's about?

    Good: [Slack](www.slack.com)'s website clearly explains for those who are unfamiliar with the site that it is an alternative to email.

    Bad: It could be difficult to navigate [Youtube](www.youtube.com) if you're completely unfamiliar with the service as the website doesn't state what the site is or does.


5. Analysis

    Question: How can you use this analysis to make improvements?

    Good: [Instagram](www.instagram) has started removing likes from user's individual posts. They beta tested this feature and found that removing likes allows users to focus more on the content of each post rather than its popularity.

    Bad: [Quora](www.quora.com) is a popular question-and-answer site. Despite years of users complaining very vocally about aspects of the site, they often ignore complaints and continue to develop features that users  dislike. For example, a few years ago they introduced bots to edit questions automatically. However, these bots often merge unrelated questions and make mistakes.
