# Day 7 Exercises

1. **How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?**

- The *Suncoast Credit Union* webpage https://www.suncoastcreditunion.com/ Is a good example of not having to work hard to get what you want. The online banking login in is right at the top of the page and it is easy to locate.

- The *Centura Health's* webpage https://www.centura.org/patients-and-families/mycenturahealthis a bad example of having to work to hard to get what you want. To me it looks like the icon of the person on the top right is to login however it just takes you to the page that you are already on. To login you have to scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the link.

1. **Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?**

- The *Watercourse Foods* website https://www.watercoursefoods.com/ is an example of good layout. It tells you what the business is about and the navigation is located at the top of the page.

- The *Migration Taco* webpage is an example of a page that could be designed more clearly. It's not super hard to navigate or figure out what it is that they do, but the size of the image and the location of the navigation bar could be better. There Taco's are the best though so I can live with it.

1. **Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?**

- The *NFL's official site* https://www.nfl.com/ is a good example of representing the brand.  
- The *Vegfest Colorado*  https://www.vegfestcolorado.org/ Is an example of a site that doesn't represent the brand the links don't feel like the same page particularly the donate link.

1. **Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?**

- The *REI* website https://www.rei.com/ is an example of a site that is clear direct and functional.

- *The Rocky Mountain National Park* website https://www.nationalparks.org/explore-parks/rocky-mountain-national-park?gclid=CjwKCAiA6bvwBRBbEiwAUER6JWxw-wmksbNWW3lImoaRdUz4T389JWedqw0q6XMawoSvdXvT4Dxa2RoCaEcQAvD_BwE is an example of a site that is not very functional. While it has plenty of information about the park and how to donate money to the park I can not find a place to reserve a campsite. There is even a section called "Tours and Camping" with no place to book a tour or reserve a campsite.



1. **How can you use this analysis to make improvements?**

 You can use analysis to see what users are actually doing versus what you expect them to do. It can help to tell you what is working well and what could use improvements. A layout that makes sense to you maybe confusing to someone else, analysis help you to identify areas that need improvement.
