## Day 7: Create a Site for Show and Tell! Also, UI/UX and Submit Your Module 0 Capstone.

## Open your local copy of frontend-module-0-capstone in Atom

In the day_7 directory, create a file called `day7-exercises.md`. This is where you'll put your answers to the following questions.

## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)

*   There is a great series of UI/UX posts called [UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals](http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals). Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

  * Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your `day7-exercises.md` file.
  1. Psychology "How does this make them feel?"
    a. Instagram.com is there for aesthetic and entertainment purposes. Their website is mostly clean and as soon as you login, it starts showing posts from other profiles that the user has expressed interest in.
    b. Salliemae.com tries to convey success in it's website but everyone knows
  2. Usability "Could you get the job done with less input from the user?"
    a. https://www.amazon.com/ makes buying things easy off of their site by allowing one-click purchasing. It sidesteps having to re-enter information everytime you buy something to make capitlism more efficient.
    b. https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home.html#/bkgd's site is ok but if you need to do things outside of booking a flight, such as managing a flight that's already been purchased, it forces the user to go through several *possible* pages and doesn't make clear exactly where one needs to go in order to complete their objective due to a lack of intuitiveness.
  3. Design "Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?"
    a. As soon as someone loads the home page for https://www.target.com/, it's immediately clear what the purpose of the site is there for as there are pictures of models showing off clothes, toys, and dvds that are shown on the homepage.
    b. https://www.icbc.com.cn/ICBC/en/default.htm fails in that you can't immediately tell what the site is for upon first glance. Pictures are slightly unrelated and few and far in between. Additionally, text is small and difficult to read.
  4. Copywriting "Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?"
    a. Even if users are familiar with tumblr, the login page runs smoothly and walks any possible new users about its uses just by scrolling down on the home page. Verbage is casual and friendly and gives a welcoming impression in unison with its bold use of colors and art style.
    b. Going back to http://www.icbc-ltd.com/icbcltd/en/, it's not entirely clear exactly what ICBC is unless you've personally opened a bank account with them in person and already knew what they were about. If clients need help on a particular issue, it's difficult to know exactly where to start.
  5. Analysis
    a. Ebay takes what you've taken a look at from before by using a cookies and creates a curated list of things you may be interested in. In addition to this, it categorizes these items into particular categories such that if you're looking for a particular type of thing, it is easy to simply generate that list from your home screen
    b. https://www.wish.com/ does something similar but instead of categorizing things for you, it throws all the items you *could* be interested in and puts it on the homescreen. If there is a particular item you're not interested in, there's not really a way to take it off of the suggested items list which adds to the clutter and only takes into account what the algorithm thinks the user might be into instead of actually using the user's input.
    



## Make A New Webpage Using Atom!

Instead of using CodePen to create this webpage, let's use Atom - our text editor. Within this directory, create another directory called `my_website`.

Within the `my_website` directory, create two files:

*   `index.html` to hold your HTML code
*   `style.css` to hold your CSS code

Your site should contain (but is not limited to):

*   Content about a subject you are passionate about! (something not about coding)
*   Headings
*   Text in paragraphs (include two different fonts)
*   Links
*   Images
*   A list (ordered or unordered)
*   A form
*   Usage of color

To see the HTML code that you've written in the browser, you can run `open index.html` from the command line. Don't forget to link your stylesheet in your `index.html` file!

If you're having trouble using Atom to create a webpage, then go ahead and use CodePen to get something built for your new site, but we would prefer that you use Atom.
