UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals
The 5 Main Ingredients of UX

Psychology
What is the user's motivation to be here in the first place?
+ https://www.google.com/ users are searching for information and this page has a simple,
prominent search bar
- https://www.pacman.com/en/ I visited the pac-man site to see if I could play the game and
learn about the history of the game, there was a brief description of the game on
the home page and no way to play or learn more

Usability
Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
+ https://www.google.com/ gets input from the user via the search bar and returns results
- https://dependablecleaners.com/ visitors are likely looking for location
You can click locations on the homepage to get a list of locations
It would be helpful to be able to search locations by zip to find the best one for you

Design
Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
+ https://www.google.com/ yes, use search bar or click I'm Feeling Lucky to use
- https://www.uat.edu/ tries to communicate with moving images but the navigation
is overloaded with options

Copywriting
Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
+ https://www.google.com/ yes, use search bar or click I'm Feeling Lucky to use
- https://www.art.yale.edu/ has a clear menu bar for users to click but the rest
of the pages design is off putting with harsh backgrounds and poor layout

Analysis
Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
I could not find examples for analysis because that is what the developers do
I can't say how they did the analysis from seeing the website
