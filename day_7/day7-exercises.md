1) Psychology

  * How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

    **supportive**: https://evolvsports.com/

    **violates**: https://prodigyprepacademy.com/

    **explanation**:

     With Evolv sports, they layed out the website in a clear manner so that the user doesn't really have to do much work. All the information is straightforward and easy to locate. Everything from the layout to the text they used, makes everything legible and easy to read. It doesn't stress out the user, while trying to locate information. It is also easy to look at with having not to many photos but enough to catch the eye of the user.

     The Prodigy Prep site, is simple in terms of it's layout but in terms of navigation there isn't anything that helps the user figure out where to go. There is a lack of information and it doesn't really explain anything about this school or what their mission is. Anyone looking to attend this school might reconsider based on the lack of information and credibility on that site.

2) Usability

  * Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?

    **supportive**: https://www.amazon.com/

    **violates**: http://www.gatesnfences.com/

    **explanation**:

    Amazon is a great example of a usable website. Each link takes you to said item of your choosing. But from each page you are still able to access all of the parts, such as the cart (you can even see what in the cart without having to click on it) or being able to go to your recent orders. It shows you the path or your search (ex. Sports & Outdoors›Sports & Fitness›Leisure Sports & Game Room›Outdoor Games & Activities›Disc Sports›Disc Golf›Bags.) If anyone has questions they can usually be found by scrolling down. And their "related items" section really helps in discovering new items.

    Gates n' Fences website has too much information. It will do the opposite and drive the user away from this webpage. A website needs to be a fun experience for the user. When it feels like you're reading a textbooks, it won't sound like fun for the majority of people. The homepage also busy with small font littering the page. They tried to add as much as possible, which I feel, tends to be an overload of information all on one page.

3) Design

  * Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

    **supportive**: https://www.netflix.com/

    **violates**: https://www.art.yale.edu/

    **explanation**:

    Netflix's site is great in terms of design. From the moment you get onto their page you immediately see, a recommended show or movie. Then it is broken down into categories, which makes it easy to find updated series or shows that you have never heard of. I could scroll thru Netflix and never get bored or confused at what I am looking at.

    Yales site, leaves the user confused and unsure of how to navigate thru the site. There is text conflicting with the background images. Even though everything has its own highlight, staring at the page for a while tends to hurt my eyes. It also reminds me of old myspace layouts, that are just congested with content. The site alone leaves me unsure of whether I should trust it's content.

4) Copywriting

  * Does it reduce anxiety?

    **violates**: http://www.roverp6cars.com/?LMCL=si3wsQ

    **explanation**:

    Denver Mountain Guides website, is clear and to the point. For someone looking to go outside and climb, they will have many questions and will want many reassurances. From the moment you access their page, you are able to see a video on who they are and what they do. They give you a background on all their guides, which is easily accessible in the drop down menu. The page is also very clean and not a whole lot of text. Each section has a "book now" button which allows the user to see all the different options they with clear and to the point information.

    For Rover Cars website, the bold letters, scrolling text, and different navigation links makes it hard to know where to look. Just like with Yale’s website, this website is too busy and cluttered. The toolbar as a green car with red lettering hard to read, taking away from the website rather than helping future customers. For someone looking for something specific, they might have a harder time trying to find an answer on this site.


5) Analysis

  * Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?

    **supportive**: https://www.google.com/

    **violates**: https://www.youtube.com/

    **explanation**:

    Google is a great example of analysis. Reason being it edits the search around its user. If I need to translate something by typing in "english to Spanish", it will pull up its own translator. It does a great job of reading the search to accommodate it. Most users would love this because instead of searching for one it provides it. Straight and to the point. Google has offered many of these options, whether it's from stocks to videos. Google has done a great job of making it simple to find the right information.

    Youtube is the most used site when it comes to distracting yourself from finishing your work. When I am on youtube I enjoy being able to scroll and find many videos regarding my search. The downside is all the adds used throughout the video. I usually like to have music or Netflix or something on in the background. What isn't great is that it will sometimes stop multiple times to play many ads. If they were to play them before and after then that would be fine but when it comes on right in the middle of an intense clip, it throws off the entire experience.  With created playlists, they have to be saved in a specific order because it won't let pick how you want to watch them. If I wanted to watch vlogs thru a playlist, from oldest to most recent, I can't because there isn't a function that would allow that. And with the ads they have links so if you accidentally click on one, it will pause the video and take you away from what you were doing.
