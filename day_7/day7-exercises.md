# Psychology

## Question: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

Supports: https://www.ursamajorvt.com/

Why: Site has a strong, simple layout with extremely easy access to their products, and a quick checkout system.

Violates: https://www.territoryfoods.com/

Why: Users can't see if the product delivers to their area until they make an account (can pick a service area, but won't show if they are in delivery zone). Many other site features are immediately blocked behind a signup paywall. Multi-step ordering process feels complicated and obtuse - meals are auto-generated for order and editing is difficult with so much content present on the page.

# Usability

## Question: Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

Supports: https://www.apple.com/

Why: The end-goal of purchasing a product is made clear from the landing page—with options to go directly to checkout from there—and minimal distractions are present throughout the funnel from landing to checkout.

Violates: https://www.americanmeadows.com/

Why: Many options are hidden from the user—such as the dropdown if you click on "account" at the top of the landing. Navigation menus are massive and confusing. CTA's constantly compete for attention and the size/color of items doesn't seem to directly reflect importance.

# Design

## Question: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

Supports: https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/

Why: Wonderful design sensibility and thoughtful, informing content that positions them as a leader in their field.

Violates: https://www.wish.com/

Why: Ripped illegal photos from Instagram for certain items, the paywall behind making an account with a rotating background of cheap items. Uncloseable modal.

# Copywriting

## Question: Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?

Supports: https://www.everlane.com/

Why: The site UI matches the visual style of the brand - modern, elegant, and minimal. CTA's are placed consistently throughout the site to compel the user to make a purchase. Checkout is easy and simple, and modal offers don't feel too distracting from the main user flow.

Violates: https://exemplars.com/sample-performance-tasks

Why: The visual interface is cluttered, visual elements are competing and distracting, many elements are far too text-heavy, and it doesn't feel obvious what the user should be doing or where they should be going.

# Analysis

## Question: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

Supports: https://www.amazon.com/

Why: Uses machine learning to consistently suggest useful relevant products to the user.

Violates: https://www.twitter.com/

Why: While Twitter uses machine learning and data science in many ways, I believe that their consistently dropping user base and refusal to listen to some of the more obvious critiques and issues with their platform are great examples of their unwillingness to learn the truth or to listen more closely to their user base.
