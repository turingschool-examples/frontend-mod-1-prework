#### UI/UX Questions

1. **Psychology - How does this make them feel?**

 [UX as a feeling](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/10/user-experience-is-a-feeling.php) seems to be a great way of assessing how your users feel or will feel about
 part of the design. Taking the feeling into consideration can make the experience more
 meaningful and memorable. This seems to be the most direct way of connecting with a
 user. It was a bit difficult to find any articles arguing for the opposite, even though some [like this one](https://uxdesign.cc/feelings-ux-how-do-they-influence-in-our-designs-bc13be3405d7) does favor data and empirical methods over direct focus on
 feelings. The only article that came close to arguing the opposite was this article on
 ["the vortex"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/device-vortex/) where they try to
 correlate the focus on feelings in UX as a big reason for interface addiction and things
 like FOMO or the scarcity principle.

 2. **Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?**
  > I found this [source](https://www.freshconsulting.com/uiux-principle-18-strive-for-simplicity-and-clarity-above-all/) that vouches for simplicity as the key to usability. Jeff argues that a lean UX will put you above the competition. This other [opinion](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/simplicity-is-overrated-in-ux-design/) does not really argue against it, but dwells in the semantic separation of what simple
  or direct can really mean to different people. He tends to favor clarity over simplicity
  as a general term and refers to simplicity as a myth built on semantic confusion.

3. **Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?**
  > There are plenty back and forth arguments of what is more important, usability or
  looks. This specific [article](https://blog.prototypr.io/ui-design-visual-attraction-e86d8559c505) mentions some studies that declare that just by looking a certain way, users will assume the usability of a site regardless of the actual results. Since
  finding articles that argue for good looks and inherent clarify of websites, I have
  added this [realpolitik article](https://medium.muz.li/ux-doesnt-matter-the-market-matters-2bf63ceb6222) that mostly argues that the market will lay waste of great
  design and fantastically clear design depending on the whims of the market.

4. **Does it reduce anxiety?**
  > Found a link that specifically talks about [interstitial anxiety](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/for-clients/how-to-improve-user-experience-design-by-optimizing-interstitial-anxiety/), the anxiety that is created when a user gets confused or frustrated by an interface. So reducing anxiety in the user by having a clear and neatly designed website will be very important. At the same time, many popular and
  successful websites will prey on your anxieties and in fact, use those anxieties to keep you engaged like youtube pushing conspiracy theory videos or amazon reminding you for the nth time of the benefits you will lose while you try to cancel prime for a month or two. This [article](https://uxdesign.cc/are-ux-designers-preying-on-customer-anxieties-thanks-to-ux-insights-545cf41d5f58) expands further on those last points.

5. **Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?**
  >[This article on UX](https://uxdesign.cc/we-have-lost-track-of-what-ux-actually-means-8d55259dacb0) expands on the same UX terms we have been seeing, but it does stress how
  the basis of the definition of UX itself, is in the subjective relation the user has to the product. The accumulation of these subjective opinions lead you to the reasons why a certain design works or does not. As for the arguing between objectivity and subjectivity in the office, the first response to [this post](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/54888/ux-is-so-subjective-that-boss-is-always-right) does illuminate a bit on how regardless of how clear these definitions might come through to the teams working on a project, other forces will affect the analysis objectivity and how the analysis is implemented.
