What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

  * Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your `day7-exercises.md` file.

1) Psychology
    "How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?"
      Supporting:https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&ictx=2&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj08IGqnNjoAhX-Ap0JHR30BcEQPQgH
      Violating:https://denver.craigslist.org/

      I normally start a search by heading to Google. Other times that search spits me out to Craigslist. Navigating and reading all those links has always been heavy lifting from a search standpoint in my opinion.

2) Usability
    "Have you provided everything the user needs to know?"
      Supporting:https://www.awwwards.com/
      Violating:https://www.art.yale.edu/

    I really struggled find examples for this concept of UX. Most of the sites I use on a daily basis are usable enough that I don't notice any friction points. I chose awwwards.com because in my search for bad examples, they had a great site full of easy to navigate beautiful examples. Yale's website, is just difficult all round. I know that I reviewed them for a usertesting assignment as well.

3) Design
    "Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things"  
      Supporting:https://basicagency.com/
      Violating: https://www.plerdy.com/blog/20-sajtov-s-uzhasnym-juzabiliti/

      For plerdy, the bars at the top of this article highlight and are hyperlink blue but go nowhere. Links with odd gradient backgrounds are further down.
      Basic is just beautiful, straight forward and everything that looks clickable is!

4) Copywriting
    "Does it reduce anxiety?"
      Supporting:https://www.calm.com/
      Violating:https://www.bbc.com/news
        I have used the Calm app for awhile now and the whole experience is calming even before you begin the exercises.

        Now I know pulling a current news website with everything going on in the world today is going to stimulate anxiety, but the copy and the layout just make the information indigestible.

5) Analysis
    "How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?"
      Supporting:https://www.hotjar.com/
      Violating:https://analytics.google.com/
        Again I find this hard to pick examples. I would think that analysis is something aggregated on the backend of the site.

       I am putting Google Analytics as violating as it can be a powerful tool, but it is hard to get into and parse that information. Hotjar tracks visual hot spots and could provide interesting and valuable data about user behavior.
