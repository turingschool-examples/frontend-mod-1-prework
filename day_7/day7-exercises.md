# Day 7 Exercises - UI/UX Assignment

## Psychology
_"How are you rewarding good behavior?"_

__Good:__ https://www.cotopaxi.com/
- They provide a fifteen percent discount through a pop-up for email signups. It's mutually beneficial because they acquire email addresses and the user gets a discount on their purchase.

- I don't think this site is bad by any means, but I do think they could do a better job of rewarding the user for "good behavior". They don't offer any discounts through email acquisition and they also don't incorporate any of their blog posts on the homepage to break up the product promotion. I think offering users interesting, rich content in a more accessible way on the homepage would help users make more of a connection with the brand.

## Usability
_"Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the userâ€™s intuition? How do you know?"_

__Good:__ https://www.everlane.com/
- I think the developer organized this site intuitively. It's categorized based on the most popular categories being most accessible. For example, the top allows you to toggle to the new shoe line and then you can search the clothing options on the top left hand corner with a drop down menu, beginning with the women's line, which is their biggest and most popular category.

- I think there should be a way to search the adventures by location since that will be one of the biggest deciding factors outside of the sport category. I think not having that option is more convenient for the company (because locations are limited) but not the user.

## Design
_"Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?"_

__Good:__ https://castirondesign.com/
- It's very eye catching and does a great job of showcasing all their work in a very visually appealing way. It immediately looks trustworthy with how sharp and organized it is.

- This homepage looks messy and isn't very visually appealing. They used a bunch of stock photography, so it looks generic and doesn't seem like they've invested in their online presence. Needs some rejuvenation!

## Copywriting
_"Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?_"

__Good:__ http://nymag.com/
- I think this website is organized in a clear manner with explicit titles, plus helpful tags for categorizing articles.

__Room for improvement:__ http://www.awesometravelandtours.com/
- It's not clear what is a link and what's not. The titles are all pretty random and the website offers no real information on travel packages. It's not functional, clear or direct.

## Analysis
_"Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts? // Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?"_

__Good:__ https://www.instagram.com/
- Instagram (and Facebook) are constantly testing new elements that directly affect the user experience. For example, I'm part of their test group where they hide the total number of likes on photos. Rather they just show one or two people that have liked it. I imagine they will use metrics from this test group that point to objective facts on behavior.

__Room for improvement:__ https://people.com/
- This website looks fine to me, but I noticed it showcases articles on the homepage based on when they were posted. I know some online magazines have sections with "most read" or "most popular" stories, and I imagine that helps keep trending articles top of mind rather than burying them with new stories.
