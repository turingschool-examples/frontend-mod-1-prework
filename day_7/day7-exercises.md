1. **Psychology:** *How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?*
A lot of work - https://www.denver.va.gov/
  There are far too many things to click on when you open the page. Choosing between the top tabs, the side buttons and their *sub-sections* is daunting.
No work - https://www.youtube.com
  You immediately have dozens of videos of various topics as well as a searchbar to narrow your results.
2. **Usability:** *Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?*
Great - https://medium.com/
  The entire front page of Medium is dedicated to telling you how you can use their site and what their mission is.
Not so great - https://humaan.com/
  Although it looks great, scrolling down through animated slides is not as responsive as I'd like it to be, so it's a bit frustrating to use.
3. **Design:** *Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?*
Yes - https://www.eugenius.com/
  This website features a sleek, modern, responsive design with professional looking animations and fantastic sound design. The attention to detail leads me to believe that this is a well-maintained website and company.
No - https://www.flashseats.com/
  The website looks like it hasn't been updated in years. This is supported by the outdated design and the presence of an iPhone 5 (7 years old) on the "We've gone mobile!" section. If I wasn't required to use this site for some concerts, I would never touch it.
4. **Copywriting:** *Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?*
Yes - https://www.airbnb.com/
  The first text your eye is drawn to says "Book unique places to stay and things to do." Right off the bat I know what the website is for and what I can accomplish by continuing to use it.
No - http://cloud9walkers.com/
  It took me a while to figure out what the point of this website was. The text doesn't have a good hierarchical flow so I'm not sure where the important info is.
5. **Analysis**
I would love to have something to put down for this section, but it isn't possible to find a site that 'supports/violates' the questions under Analysis. These are questions that someone collecting user experience data from their website would ask themselves, so finding a website that 'supports/violates' a question like: "Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?" is not a clear prompt. This portion of the Day 7 prompts need to be adjusted to make a bit more sense.
