### Psychology

The mind of a user is complex. You should know; you have one (I assume). UXers work with subjective thoughts & feelings a lot; they can make or break your results. And the designer must ignore their own psychology sometimes too, and that’s hard! Ask yourself:

#### 1. How does it make them feel?

* Supports - The overall appearance is inviting. https://www.apartments.com/    

* Violates - There is a lot going on, information overload. The site feels overwhelming.

### Usability

If user psychology is mostly subconscious, usability is mostly conscious. You know when something is confusing. There are cases where it is more fun if something is hard — like a game — but for everything else, we want it to be so easy.

#### 2. Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)

* Supports - The links have more space between them.  They also have a hover affect to identify you're on a clickable link.

* Violates - The clickable links are too small. It's difficult to recognize they are active links.

### Design

As the UX designer, your definition of “design” will be much less artistic than a lot of designers. Whether you “like it” is irrelevant. In UX, design is how it works, and it’s something you can prove; it’s not a matter of style. Ask yourself:

#### 3. Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

* Supports - The site is clean and the intent is clear.  You can search service area without having to scroll down.

* Violates - This website looks fake.  It's very plain and looks very suspicious.

### Copywriting

There is a huge difference between writing brand copy (text) and writing UX copy. Brand copy supports the image of the company. UX copy gets shit done as directly and simply as possible. Ask yourself:

#### 4. Does it reduce anxiety?

* Supports - Although there is a lot going on, the copy is sectioned off and less overwhelming.

* Violates - The page copy is small, difficult to read and links at the bottom are barely legible due to the high contrast of the background.

### Analysis

In my opinion, most designers’ weak spot is analysis. But we can fix that! Analysis is the main thing that separates UX from other types of design, and it makes you extremely valuable. It literally pays to be good at it. So, ask yourself:

#### 5. Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?

* Supports - Amazon has a great chatbot messaging assistant.  The bot asks a series of questions and attempts to solve your issue.  You'll also receive a survey at the end to gather additional information about your experience.  You are prompted to complete the survey immediately after your inquiry.

* Violates - Forever 21 requires you to either fill out a contact form or place a phone call.  You'll receive a response with 24 hours via email if you filled out the online contact form.  I'm unsure if Forever 21 follows up with a satisfaction survey. If so, they are still lacking as they don't have a chat feature to address issues in real time.

**Note: It was challenging coming up with examples for the Analysis section as I do not have access to web analytics.**
