1. How are you rewarding good behaviour?
  Papa John's: https://www.papajohns.com/order/papa-rewards
    The Papa John's website rewards customers by giving them
    a point for every dollar spent and the home page rewards
    customers for visiting the site by making specials and
    deals readily available.
  Argren: http://arngren.net/
    This insecure and cluttered site does little to motivate
    users to buy.
2. Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
  Kayak: https://www.kayak.com
    I use Kayak for all my flights. The purpose is clear and
    concise. You just enter in your preferred flight plans and
    it finds you a list flights in the order you choose.
  Scrim: http://scr.im/
    Scrim converts your email to a link to hide it from bots
    searching for email to spam, but I don't feel that this
    information is made a hundred percent clear on the homepage.
    Some of the text also looks like links while an important
    link at the top doesn't even look like a link.
3. Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
  Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/
    Amazon immediately draws you in with products tailored to
    your past searches and purchases. It's widely trusted above
    other similar websites that connect you with vendors because
    of its reputation and security.
  Short Reckonings: http://www.shortreckonings.com/sr#mysheets
    The font on Short Reckonings is too small and unattractive.
    It does little to inspire confidence or explain how it
    works before users sign up.
4. Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
  Smile Direct Club: https://smiledirectclub.com/
    I think that the message is stated clearly and directly so
    as to motivate a user to continue the process of signing up.
    They obviously want to convert, so the goal is achieved.
  Live Stream: https://livestream.com/
    It's my opinion that this website doesn't do enough to
    convince the user of its value before making the sale.
    The home page is only a short statement and a long list of field pops up when you click to get started.

5. Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
  750 words: https://750words.com/
    This may be a website for writers but the text on this
    website is a bit overwhelming and makes it difficult to
    figure out how the website works and why you should
    continue.
  Google: https://www.google.com/
    Google.com is the most clear and direct webpage and I can
    think of and their success is indisputable.
