- good: https://www.wheatridgecyclery.com/ Even though the site is a little busy, it is easy to shop.

2. Usability: Are you being clear and direct, or is this just a little too complicated?

- good: https://www.theonion.com/ Very easy to begin searching.

- bad: https://www.westword.com/ The search bar is not immediately available. The side menu where it is hidden looks nice, but it seems like a news site should promote searching there site.


3. Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

- good: https://www.maddogsgunsandgear.com/ This looks professional. I would feel more confident ordering from this site.

- bad: https://www.luckydogfirearms.com/ This looks very generic and doesn't give me confidence.


4. Copywriting: Is the biggest text the most important text?

- good: https://www.washingtonpost.com/ The logo is front and center. I know exactly what is going on.

5. Analysis: Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
