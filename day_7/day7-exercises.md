Psychology- How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
GOOD imdb.com (All newest content and headlines are at the front homepage without needing to scroll down, also the search function is top and center and gives auto recommendations as you are typing)
BAD seekingalpha.com (home page has an overwhelming amount of small text. I clicked on one of the primary headlines and saw it was filled with comments about how it was an unconfirmed news story out of speculation, not good material to put on the front homepage if someone is looking for reliable news to work off of.)

Usability- Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
GOOD ign.com (All new and top headlines are clear and at the top of the page, logging in is done without going to a separate page and is clearly visible at the top highlighted in red, even things such as international donation relief is clear, clickable and at the top of the page.)
BAD chase.com (Initially takes you to a welcome screen that then requires you to click a "log in" button that then takes you to a login page. For a site that 99% of users will be logging into this seems like bad design to make it a separate page.)

Design- Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
GOOD foxnews.com (uses blue text on all clickable items similar to the companies blue logo and all video content has thumbnails and easy to read descriptions also with blue text, Easy to discern between video and article content. Most relevant news is top and center with the biggest text. A live feed of the television network streams in a small window in the corner while browsing the home page.)
BAD pbs.org (very mixed messaging on the home page requires the user to click just to access the most basic of information. Top headlines require the user to scroll down the page and the top and center headlines are about pbs orchestra concerts and require multiple clicks from the user to get detailed information)

Copywriting- Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
GOOD aaa.com (Immediately clear that they are selling a service and has access to everyone of their services from the opening home screen due to mouse hover buttons at the top of the screen showing you more detailed information as your mouse moves over the options. If users do not know where to begin there are large, clear "join today" and "renew membership" buttons in the center of the homepage that does not require any scrolling)
BAD gamestop.com (user is immediately hit with full screen ads, top of the page has far too many options including "powerup rewards" "trade ins" being separate buttons next to the log in button. What one would assume should be the homepage with the most relevant information and content requires the user to scroll down past the ads)

Analysis- Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
GOOD ign.com (Goes through an annual site redesign based upon user interaction making it a constant iterative process of making the site more accessible every year that the company is still around. Currently the site is highly readable and understandable with clickable links and clear buttons presented for the user.)
BAD vortex.com (Website appears to have information displayed without any sense of consistency or user friendly design. Links are not lined up or presented in a consistent fashion that conveys implied rules to the user.)
