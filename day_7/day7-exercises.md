Question 1 - Psychology: Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often? <br /><br />
To create an effective user experience for users, developers need to understand how to relate to user's needs when building their webpages. Here is one good website that allows users to use the website again and again. <br />
The Good: http://www.Amazon.com <br />
This website is good at maintaining an effective psychological understanding of users by providing recommendations of products that users may be interested in.  By doing that, it brings in users back in buying more products. <br />
The Bad: http://arngren.net <br />
This website is designed poorly.  Too many items that are on one webpage.  Compared to Amazon, the Arngren website make it difficult for users to look at items and Amazon have a clean look where items are easier to be found.  This type of design by Arngren makes them don't want to visit their website again. <br /><br />
Question 2 - Usability: Could you get the job done with less input from the user? <br /><br />
Simple usability of a website is important to focus on to help users use the website effectively. <br />
The Good: http://Google.com <br />
Google is a great product where users are able to search for anything they need to know.  Google keep their website simple by providing a search bar for users to search for anything they are interested in. <br />
The Bad: http://Yahoo.com <br />
Yahoo has too much content in their homepage.  Many ads consume the home page and the usability of Yahoo website can put off user's interest in the website.  Google had keep it simple for user's usability, while Yahoo tries to force unneeded or unrelated content on users when user's intention is just for a simple search engine. <br /><br />
Question 3 - Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately? <br /><br/>
A webpage design is important because it can attract users to use their platform.  If a design is not well made, then users will turn to other alternatives to fulfill their needs. <br />
The Good: http://Facebook.com <br />
Facebook is well designed for a social media website.  Facebook had kept their website design simple and consistent throughout its website.  Sometime simple design is best when fulfilling user's needs of a social media account. <br />
the Bad: http://Myspace.com <br />
MySpace has too many ads and pop-up windows on their main site.  With that type of design, first time users are not able to tell if it was a social media website or a gossip website with many ads and entertainment news.  The design is poorly made to attract users. <br /><br />
Question 4 - Copywriting: Does it reduce anxiety? <br /><br />
Sometime a website can cause anxiety for users because there are too much content on one webpage.  When there are too much content, users can be overwhelmed by its content.  Simple design can accomplish more a design with too much content. <br />
The Good: https://www.arapahoecountyfair.com/ <br />
This website is the Arapahoe Country Fair.  This website provide information on Arapahoe Country Fair and their events, competition, and contact information.  The website is made simple with links to their information when users click on the tabs. Keeping a simple designed website reduce the problems of anxiety because users know what to expect on their website and know how to navigate any information on the website. <br />
The Bad: http://www.rudgwicksteamshow.co.uk/ <br />
This is the Rudgwick Steam and Country Show website.  There is a clutter of images on the main page and it can create anxiety for its users.  The website is not good on the eyes and can be distracting.  The website is poorly designed where all of its content doesn't flow smoothly. <br /><br />
Question 5 - Analysis: How can you use this analysis to make improvements? <br /><br />
Analysis is important to determine the effectiveness of a website design.  By analyzing a website, developers are able to make changes to a website to better improve the overall UX of a website. <br />
The Good: https://www.stevinsonauto.com/ <br />
This auto dealership provides a well-designed user interface for its users to looks for their desired automobiles.  Analyzing this website, it provides all the information users need when looking for a car, locations, inventory, prices, and auto repair/services.  The website is not perfect and one recommendation to improve the website is to allow the users to disable the automatic play of the video.  By doing that, it allows users to load up the website quicker without the need of loading video content. <br />
The Bad: https://www.lingscars.com/ <br />
There is too much going on in this website for a car dealership.  Music, gifs, video, and too much content on one page make it difficult for users to look for cars.  With all of these distractions coming at the users at once, nothing can be accomplished on this website.  This is where analyzing a website is important because flaws can be found and with that, changes can be made to improve the overall UX of a website.  My recommendation for changes on this website is everything because no one can take this business seriously.  The website looks like more of a joke website than a business.  If a business strive to follow this website design, then they will run into problems of keeping users loyalty.
