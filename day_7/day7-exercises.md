What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.

UX- User Experience, a good User Experience does not simply make the website easy to look on the eyes, instead it should create a sense of efficiency and effectiveness with the user.

User Goals- What the user is trying to get out of their experience on the site. For example on wikipedia, the common user goal is to attain information on a desired subject.

Business Goals- What the business is trying to get out of the site. This can range goals such as monetary gain, or overall promotion of brand awareness among users.

Psychology- The mindset the user is in when browsing on your site.
  "How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?"

  Supports- https://www.ubersignlanguage.com/ Simple step by step guides to    communicate sometimes complex speech patterns.

  Violates- https://denver.craigslist.org/ Although most of us are used to using this site by now, initially the user can be overwhelmed with all of the options presented.

Usability- Making things not complicated for the user by trying to make objects as intuitive as possible on the site.
  "Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?"

  Supports- https://www.google.com/ As simple as of homepage as you can imagine. When you use google, you are looking for something (or feeling lucky) and this site takes you to your desired location as quickly as possible.

  Violates- http://arngren.net/ Found this site through a search for non user friendly websites, I immediately felt a sense of anxiety.

Design- Whether the site is visually appealing, communicates the purpose of the site effectively, and is easy to use.
  "Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?"
  Supports- https://www.amazon.com/ Although amazon sells products from many different distributors, it still maintains a sense of uniformity across the various products.

  Violates- http://www.roverp6cars.com/?LMCL=K144R Similar to the previous violation site, this site tries to do too much, or does not effectively separate items in an easy to view context.

Copywriting- Whether the text communicates what the user should do.
  "Does it reduce anxiety?"

  Supports- https://www.wikipedia.org/ Similar to how google is set up, it takes into account what the user is trying to to while on the site (this could be used as an example for Analysis as well), and streamlines the process to get the user to their goal as quickly as possible.

  Violates- https://www.art.yale.edu/ Surprising for a school like Yale, this website lacks a consistent color profile and looks like a first attempt at html (I would know, a lot of my current builds look like this). But maybe this is art and I do not have a refined enough taste to appreciate it.

Analysis- The use of data in order to make improvements to the sight. Managing feedback from users so that the user experience is more enjoyable for them.
  "Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?"

  Supports- https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/ This is a site that I have been using for well over a decade, initially to learn songs on guitar. Over time I have noticed however, that more of their content has been geared towards news within the musical industry. This could be based on the fact that user engagement has been higher in articles, therefore the site dedicates more resources to cater to this.

  Violates- https://www.uat.edu/ Where to start, I think this is a good case of a site trying to do too much. First, there are so many elements that the site takes a while to load. Second, the font on the drop down menu is way to small.
