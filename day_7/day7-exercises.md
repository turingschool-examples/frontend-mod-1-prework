      UX is the design of the user's experience.

      User Goals is what the user wants (based on research), Business Goals (brand awareness, sell a product, recruit community members).
      
      5 main ingredients: psychology, usability, design, copywriting, analysis.


2. After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

    Post links to the sites and brief descriptions.

    a. PSYCHOLOGY: What is the user's motivation to be here in the first place?

      Good ex: https://www.google.com/

        Google is simple and sleek. User's main purpose to visit this site is to "google" (now a used verb colloquially), a search on the internet. Google recognizes this and keeps it easy to do so.

      Bad ex: https://yahoo.com/

        Yahoo's website has so many functionality's piled up together, making it look like an early 2000's scrapbook. Their news, weather, horoscope, search engine, and mailbox are all jumbled on top of each other on the front page. What is the main purpose and intention of this webpage?

    b. USABILITY: Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

      Good ex: https://google.com/

        Google does a good job of keeping a "less is more" mentality, much like how Apple does.

      Bad ex: https://yahoo.com/

        As previously stated, this website overwhelms the user. Detracting information and adding in more white space could help the user digest the information better.

    c. DESIGN: Does it represent the bran? Does it all feel like the same site?

      Good ex: https://twitter.com/

        Twitter does a good job of keeping with their formatting across all pages of their website, both on a desktop or their mobile app.

      Bad ex: https://facebook.com/

        Facebook recently updated the look of their website. This is a subjective opinion, but I think it looks more confusing now. It seems like they're copying Twitter, but it's confusing as Facebook has more social media functioning than Twitter. So some of their functions are now hidden and less intuitive.

    d. COPYWRITING: Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?

      Good ex: https://amazon.com/

        I personally feel Amazon's website is a tad overwhelming, but I think that's their purpose anyway. They want to show you similar items to what you have viewed or bought before, to hopefully convince you to keep buying. They want to entice more consumerism through their platform.

      Bad ex: https://ebay.com/

        EBay's website is dated to me. I think it's the sharp boxes, text font, search bar, and bidding setup on individual items. It doesn't feel updated even though I think it is slightly. Perhaps this is why the younger generation is moving to re-sale sites such as Depop and Poshmark.

    e. ANALYSIS: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

      Good ex: https://amazon.com/

        Amazon's reviews are widely used amongst their customers, along with the company's customer support. There is no doubt they use user feedback to optimize and improve their business operations.

      Bad ex: https://poshmark.com/

        For a website dealing with one user selling to another, their internal messaging system does not even exist. A user needs to comment on a posting to have any communication. This is clunky and confusing. Furthermore, there is no option to leave reviews on items purchased, so unlike the website Etsy, user's cannot check that former customers were happy with their experience.
