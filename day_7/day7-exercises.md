### Reading (UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals)

**1. Psychology: Are you thinking of the userâ€™s wants and needs, or your own?**

Supports question: [Google](https://www.google.com/)

   - The Google search engine page has always had a minimal interface that I feel benefits the user. The layout directly supports my reason, as the user, for being on the page. In direct opposition to this would be Yahoo. Eww!
   
Violates question: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)

   - I've used Vimeo for many years. Initially, their landing page was designed for content *consumers*. It is now a page describing their subscription model for content *providers*, with the actual content to consume embedded within a navigation list item. The site is no longer made with me (the content consumer) in mind, it is made to entice content providers to subscribe. I now am less inclined to use the vimeo website for content, I typically access their content via an app on my streaming devices. Perhaps this was intentional however on occasion I just want to access content on my main computer from their website.

**2. Usability: Have you provided everything the user needs to know?**

Supports question: [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)

   - The purpose of the site is clear from the outset and well organized. I understand my options of how to nagivate the site and find what I'm looking for.
   
Violates question: [Gamer's Guild Boulder](http://www.gamersguildboulder.com/)

   - I cannot tell immediately what services are offered by this business or which products they carry.

<br />

**3. Design: Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?**

Supports question: [Duo Security](https://duo.com/)

   - The design, type, and brand is cohesive.

Violates question: [Yale School of Art](http://art.yale.edu/)

   - This department at Yale does not contain any of the branding from the main Yale site. If it wasn't for the URL, I wouldn't trust that I was actually visiting a Yale website.

<br />

**4. Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?**

Supports question: [Paper Sizes](https://papersizes.io/)

   - There is very little waste on this page.

Violates question: [University of Advancing Technology](https://www.uat.edu/)

   - The navigation is too complex and the format used only detracts from the usability of the site.

<br />

**5. Analysis: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?**

Supports question: [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com)

   - Amazon has implemented a number of features over the years that I feel prove they are data driven. An example of this is the "1-click" buy option.

Violates question: [Tortoise and Hare](https://www.tortoiseandhare.com/)

   - This is a small, local business that lacks the technical knowledge to analyze their online presence.
