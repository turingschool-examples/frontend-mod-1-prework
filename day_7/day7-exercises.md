### 1. Psychology: What is the user's motivation to be here in the first place?
Good: https://www.netflix.com/
The user comes to this website to either: watch movies or tv with an account they already have, or sign up for an account.  If they have an account it immediately shows what's available to watch.  If they don't, the site does a good job of promoting their subscription and showing unfamiliar users the features included with subscription.

Bad: https://aintwet.nyc/
This is a website about...  Actually I don't know what this website is.  To enter the site you need to click on a button labeled 'start'.  There you will find a shop.  What do they sell?  T-shirts, some vinyl records, Welch's Fruit Snacks.  You know, the usual.  I don't know what would motivate a user to go to this site other than an addiction to off-brand clothing, obscure music from people pushing mixtapes in Times Square, and fruit snacks. Okay, the fruit snacks might be this website's saving grace.

### 2. Usability: Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
Good: https://bandcamp.com/
This site is about exploring new music and supporting independent artists.  If you want to know how what artists are being purchased right now, there's info on that.  If you want to sign up as a record label to discover new talent, there's a link to that.  Everything a user could want or need related to finding and sharing music is supplied on the page.

Bad: https://www.alfredsung.com/
At first glance, this site is well put together.  It looks clean and professional.  After digging a little deeper, you find some pretty big issues.  In the 'Eyeware' section, the user learns about the high quality of their Italian-made glasses.  You can see that they sell glasses for people with *exquisite taste* (their words, not mine).  Great! So where can I find a catalog?  Bueller?  Bueller?  Nothing.  Maybe the other pages have something good.  The 'Dresses' tab will bring you to another page, formatted similarly to the 'Glasses' link.  However, the 'Dresses' page provides a link to what seems like a third-party site that sells their garments.  For all the custom, in-house design, you would think they would want to actually sell their products in-house?

### 3. Design: Does it represent the brand?  Does it all feel like the same site?
Good: https://www.thrashermagazine.com/
From the font to the color pallet used to the stylization of familiar symbols (facebook, instagram), this site represents their brand very well.  Every page has a similar feel and it is clear that each page is part of the same brand.

Bad: https://www.art.yale.edu/
This looks more like an abandoned myspace page designed by a blind, reclusive, cat lady than it does a site about an ivy league art program.  It is a horrible example of what to expect leaving their program.  This does all feel like the same site in that it looks like someone Google'd "best memes", scrolled to page 27, and copy/pasted them onto the page.

### 4. Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
Good: https://www.themarquistheater.com/
This website is incredibly simple and direct.  There is an event calendar that shows all booked events at the venue with links to purchase tickets.  There are also links to their sister venues with events in the same format.  This site contains only pertinent information and is simple in its styling.  

Bad: http://www.007museum.com/
This site is for a James Bond museum in Sweden.  I don't know much about 007 fandom in Scandinavia.  What I do know is that it is far from clear and direct.  Simple?  Very.  Functional?  The jury's still out.  This page has an incredible amount of content with absolutely no sense of organization.  There is no way to easily navigate the page.  Scrolling to the bottom of the page took so much time, it rivaled a full Bond movie runtime.  At least the fact that they included information on EVERY SINGLE ITEM in the museum saved us all a trip to Nybro.

### 5. Analysis: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
Good: https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs
This is one of my favorite podcasts.  Science Vs. tackles hot button issues and uses science to either prove or disprove the claims.  Each episode has a transcript which includes the dozens and dozens of citations that support or deny the various allegations.  They are very unbiased and certainly use data to find the truth.

Bad: https://flatearthconference.come
This site is exactly what it's URL implies.  It provides information about the annual flat earth conference.  In the "About" section there is information with supposedly real data that *proves* the earth is flat.  This is a clear example of people using data to prove they are right.  There is no attempt to seek truth.  I know we're supposed to be empathetic here at Turing, but *come on*!!!
