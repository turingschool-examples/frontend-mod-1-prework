## Psychology

### How does this make them feel?

Positive Example: https://gusto.com/ (This site has a clean and clear design that anticipates its user's need to able to easily find information. I think it would make you feel more at ease.)

Negative Example: https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en.html (This site has far too much information and immediately overwhelms the user. This would make the person looking for information to be frustrated and lost.)

## Usability

### Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?

Positive Example: https://slate.com/ (Slate has a lot of sections and subheading, but the information is easy to find and well organized. Despite the interesting layouts and buttons, you can still find what you're looking for.)

Negative Example: https://dmns.org/ (DMNS has a website that is far too focused on design over function. To find any specific information requires digging through small menus at the bottom of the page. The clever panel design stops people from being able to do what they want on the site.)

## Design

### Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

Positive Example: https://www.youtube.com/ (YouTube has a clean and easy to understand design that is so well done that it has introduced many standards now used on other media hosting sites. This is a sign of an effective design.)

Negative Example: https://www.drudgereport.com/ (The Drudge Report is read by millions of people, and all of them agree that it looks terrible. There is no effort put into the design, and it hasn't changed to be more user friendly in more than a decade. If you didn't know what this site was, you would think it was disreputable just based on the design.)

## Copywriting

### Does it reduce anxiety?

Postiive Example: https://pcpartpicker.com/ (PC Part Picker makes sure that the first button you see says "Build Guides," with some comforting text that approaches the user not as an idiot with no clue, but a person who is going to complete the task and may want some ideas on how others did the same thing. Anxiety is reduced because you get right to what you want and aren't exposed to prices at first.)

Negative Example: https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/ (This site has the user bombarded with ads for expensive products first thing. You have to scroll down to find help building a computer, and they call it the "EZPC Builder," which may make the user feel like they are getting information intended for beginners. Anxiety is increased by the immediate exposure to prices and having to search for the computer build advice they're looking for.)

## Analysis

###  Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

Positive Example: https://fivethirtyeight.com/ (FiveThirtyEight is a site all about data and proper data analysis. They're aggregate of polls and the way they weigh some pieces data to have more statistical value than others is a constantly refining model. They are on the extreme end of taking data and understanding how to get use out of it, but they have principals that everyone can adopt.

Negative Example: https://www.cbr.com/ (This and many other "Pop Culture News" sites are terrible about understanding what data to value and how to leverage it. Articles that are controversial or trying to push a sub-community of fan's buttons get a lot of traffic and more comments than most other content. But this draws out a toxic group of people who are only engaging with the content because it angers them. This may be engagement, but it's not positive engagement and it isn't a sustainable business model. Many sites have failed to evaluate the quality of their user interaction and not just the quantity.)
