### UX Questions/Answers ###

Sites that I personally think violate these principals:

I am going to pick on one particular website a lot on this assignment. I love the company, they have provided me with a great deal of useful, critically important information, but the website does not work well, in my opinion.

1. **Psychology**: I am looking at the Wrightslaw <http://wrightslaw.com > website and asking "how does this make them feel?". The site is touted as being the go-to source for parents advocating for children's special education services, but the site is not designed to welcome a person who isn't a professional. Parents who come to this site are already upset and overwhelmed, but there is nothing calming or comforting about the site. The page is very dense with text and links, only the adds on the sides have any pictures, and there is a lot of jargon. Parents are likely to feel even more overwhelmed.
3. **Usability**: I am still looking at the Wrightslaw website, and the question "is it easy to find?". There is a page full of information and links on a variety of topics in no obvious order, people are looking for fairly specific information. There is a search box, but it does not stand out on the page, and since it is located next to buttons to link to social media on the upper right-hand side of the page, it is not clear that you are going to search the site (which you are) rather than just conduct a google search. In fact, the box says 'google custom search' which some people have told me confused them.
4. **Design**: "Does the design lead the user's eye to the right place? How do you know?" On the Wrightslaw main page, other than the advertisements on the side of the page, and bold text beginning a new subject, there is nothing to guide the reader's eye. There is no use of color, borders, images or anything else to lead a reader to what they need, and the subject do not seem to have any order at all.
5. **Copywriting** "Does it reduce anxiety" I think that the Wrightslaw main page is likely to increase anxiety for people who are not professionals (and maybe even many that are) It is just visually dense and overwhelming, and then add in the heavy use of jargon within the text, many people are going to feel that they are in the wrong place. This page does not make any use of color, blank space or images to reduce anxiety.
6. **Analysis** "Are you using data to prove that you are right or to learn the truth?" I am not aware of any analysis being done by the Wrightslaw website. They do not request feedback on the layout or the design as far as I know, and I have subscribed to their newsletter for years.


Sites that I personally think do well with these principals

I am going to use Amazon <http://www.amazon.com> to illustrate these principals, because even though I think that there business practices are questionable, they do a good job with the website (in my uneducated opinion)
1. **Psychology**" How does this make them feel?" I think that they do a pretty good job. They welcome the customer by name, there is a lot of content, but large, well spaced images and if you are a return customer, the images relate to previous searches or purchases. It's welcoming.
3. **Usability**"Is it easy to find?" The page has a large, central search window, with a dropdown for categories and when you select an item, it suggests similar items to compare it to and companion items. It makes it easy to find what you are looking for, and it provides a built in 'upsell' that looks like an additional service.
4. **Design**"Does the design lead the user's eye to the right place? How do you know?" There are separate sections, with headings like "related to item's you've viewed", clear images of the items and arrows to invite you to scroll. I'm not sure how I know that this works, except to say that I am frequently hooked into looking
5. **Copywriting** "Does it reduce anxiety?" the page makes good use of open spaces, color and images, and provides a 5 star rating system that is next to any item, so you can see what other users think of it. I think that makes people feel like they are in good hands.
6. **Analysis** "Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth" Amazon does accept feedback from the customers and responds fairly quickly (although they are not as available to the sellers) They clearly collect information about buying trends and will offer items that other consumers of your purchases have also ordered, sometimes with amusing results.
