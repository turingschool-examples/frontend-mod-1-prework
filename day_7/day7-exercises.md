<h2>Psychology</h2>
<h3>Question: What do they expect when they click this?</h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://denver.craigslist.org/">Craigslist Denver</a>
<p>Craigslist does a good job of simply labeling each link and then taking the user directly to that page. It is clear whether the user is clicking on a type of job, type of item for sale, creating a posting or changing to a nearby city.
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://foursquare.com/top-places/denver/best-places-groceries">Four Square, Top 15 Places for Groceries in Denver</a>
<p>There are a few weird areas on this web page. First off, each picture above the grocery store name allows you to click on it and will take you to the specific grocery store page on Four Square. I find this a bit odd as the picture themselves do not contain the grocery store name. I would expect the pictures to not contain links at all. An area where I would expect a link would be the rating in the green box by each store. I would expect you to click on the 8.3 and it would then take you to a breakdown of all the different ratings and comments. There is no link on the ratings.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<h3>Question: Could you get the job done with less input from the user? </h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
<p>Amazon does a great job of making purchases easy and requiring little input. If you see a product you like you can skip the check out process and use the "Buy with One Click" button. Household items are easy to reorder and can be set up on a subscription.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/best-christmas-songs-playlist-fairytale-of-new-york-santa-baby-winter-wonderland-pogues-crosby-a8692646.html">The 18 Best Christmas Songs</a>
<p>This site is similar to other Top 10, Top 100, 50 Best, etc sites where you have to click through each item in order to get to the next. In order to see the number one song, you have to click through each of the other 17 songs in a slideshow fashion. I'm guessing this design is to help with advertisements as you have to access many pages instead of just one. This site is espeically bad as it is hard to even see where to start the slideshow with all the ads and videos scattered throughout the page. The job could have been done with just one click from the user, instead it will take approximately 20 to find out what the number one Christmas Song is.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>Question: Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details? </h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>
<p>Overall, I think the NYT website does a good job with its layout, colors and typography. It has the feel of a newspaper and the different headings make it clear what is most important.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>
<p>Also, the NYT website for the simple reason that add space takes up the upper half to a third of the page when first opened on my browser. The size of the ad may change but currently there is a giant Acura ad that takes away from the rest of the design of the page. This seems to be an area where business goals and user goals are a bit unaligned.
<h2>Copywriting</h2>
<h3>Question: Does it reduce anxiety?</h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com">Tempurpedic</a>
<p>This site does a good job of conveying a comfortable feel that goes along with the mattress company's image. It has a lot of information but does not overwhelm. The color combos and pictures help to reduce user anxiety as well.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a>
<p>This page is set up similar to the NYT page with a giant add on top. Unlike the NYT page it is not as easy to follow the links to all the articles. The top Trending section seems out of place and too small of font. There are too many pictures in my opinion. It all feels a bit overwhelming as you look for an article to go to. There are also more adds sprinkled in between the links which does not help the user experience.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Question: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?</h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://apnews.com/">The Associated Press News</a>
<p>The Associated Press news website is much different than many news sources. The headlines are straightforward and based off of facts, not trigger words. There is no opinion section, just news stories. I believe that the site does a much better job than other news sources of using data to learn the truth rather than trying to prove a point.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/">Fox News</a>
<p>Despite your political leanings, it is not hard to see that the Fox News website is more concerned with using data to prove their views than to get to the truth. The website is designed with headlines and keywords that point the reader in a certain direction. Keywords are often used to trigger the reader for example; "socialism seduces Americans," "Fake News," and "Fox News: Democracy 2020." If Fox News were simply a political organization it would be much different. However, many people go to Fox News in order to get the news and in many cases are not seeing the whole truth.  The bias in the articles has been confirmed by many third party reports. To be fair there are sites on the left that are similar in bias such as Huffington Post or New Republic.</p>
<h2>Analysis: Part 2</h2>
<p>I'm not 100% satisfied with my above response. Although I do think it answers the question, I feel like the reasons for each site to be how they are have more to do with the companys objective than the UX that was developed. For that reason I decided to answer another question that I believe has more to do with the UX.</p>
<h3>Question: Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?</h3>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>
<p>At the end of every stay, Airbnb sends the customer a brief survey that is used to rate the host. The questions they ask are excellent and are used to not only rate the host but also to verify the amneties, etc. It's been a few months since my last Airbnb survey but the quesitons are along the line of; "Was the house/room clean?", "Was there parking?", "Were there any stairs?", "Was the host friendly?" The questions do a really good job of answering the important questions that will be relevant to other users and to gather the information objectively. There is spot for comments as well.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>
<p>Yelp allows users to rate restaurants, businesses and more. It is very wide open on how someone rates by just giving the user 1-5 stars in order to rate. There is a spot for comments as well but it allows for to much subjectivity.</p>
