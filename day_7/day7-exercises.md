### User Interface/User Experience questions;

* UX does not mean a <i>User's Experience</i>. UX means <i>Understanding</i> the users experience. UX develops a more effective way of providing a solution to issues when it comes to the design of a page as well as the needs of the user. The user goals and business goals are; user goals are as simple as anything that a user wants to find on the web. Business goals are the reason why the business creates a web page in the first place, whether that be making people be aware of a situation or getting funds for the Australia fires. The trick is aligning these two goals. Having the business benefit from the user clicking on their website is the best goal in this situation. The five main ingredients of UX are; psychology, usability, design, copywriting, and analysis.

* Psychology;
  - <i> How much work does the user have to do to get what they want? </i>
  - This site is great at supporting this question because the site is providing information on ways to make your markdown sheet look the way you want it to look with examples and results right in front of you. You do not have to do a great amount of search to get what you are looking for.  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
  - This site violates this question because there are multiple paragraphs that takes you a while to understand how to change the look of your markdown page. https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started


* Usability;
  - <i> Have you provided everything the user needs to know? </i>
  - This site is great because I wanted to know how to make Earl Grey Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the recipe was right on the front page. It also gives pictures and discusses the background of flavors of earl grey. So, more than I wanted! https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/earl-grey-lemon-ricotta-pancakes/
  - This is a horrible site. Pinterest makes it complicated to get the recipe because you must be a member of pinterest and because I am not a member, I am not able to see what I need to know. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/73887250125382905/


* Design;
  - <i>Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?</i>
  - This site has a great representation of clickable things looking different. As you hover over the purses, it shows you another picture of the models with the bags causing you to want to click on it and be more excited about your search. https://www.statusanxiety.com.au/collections/womens-bags?gclid=Cj0KCQiAs67yBRC7ARIsAF49CdXXqDx69OkMYFyqewT_Jm2gFotKki2v8V0LI-ohtDDWqAFc9Ill634aAiyQEALw_wcB
  - This site shows the bags, but when you hover over the pictures, the pictures do not change. However, the curser changes to a finger, but because the pictures are so close together, the curser always is a finger, so it violates this question on do the items look different. https://www.theiconic.com.au/status-anxiety/

* Copywriting;
  - <i>Does it reduce anxiety?</i>
  - This site does reduce anxiety for me. It shows me why orange theory works, what you should click on, and if you're a first timer or not. I feel comfortable with the flow on this site. https://www.orangetheoryfitness.com/
  - This site gives me a little anxiety. I am not sure what Barre Code even is until I sit for a second and let the pictures scroll through. Also, what I've noticed is not many people know that the three lines in the upper right corner is. It is the menu, but I know my mom would have difficulty with that. So, where do you go from here? https://thebarrecode.com/

* Analysis;
  - <i> Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts? </i>
  - I am looking for objective facts.
  - This site does talk about subjective opinions when it comes to benefits of being a cat owner, but it more so brings in objective scientific benefits of being a cat owner. So objective facts is more relevant to this site. https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/51154/10-scientific-benefits-being-cat-owner
  - This site violates this question, because it is more subjective on why cats are better than dogs instead of the scientific objectivness that is cats being better then dogs. https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-cats-are-better-than-dogs-554880
