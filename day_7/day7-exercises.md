## Psychology
1. How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
    * Good example: https://www.yelp.com/
    * Bad example: https://www.zara.com/us/

    * Zara is used as the bad example because their site takes a lot of clicking and scrolling to find what you need.  However, on Yelp, you can immediately start typing.  Plus, it's also easier to digest since the photos aren't oversized and chunky.

## Usability
2. Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
    * Good example: https://www.southwest.com/
    * Bad example: https://www.sandals.com/royal-caribbean/

    * The Sandals Resort page is a bad example because it asks what days you want to visit, but when you put in your information, nothing happens.  You have to click into rooms and then click through each one and put in dates every time you look at a room. Not intuitive at all.  Southwest is the good example since all of their inputs work, and they only take the bare minimum amount of information from you.

## Design
3. Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
    * Good example: https://www.patagonia.com/home/
    * Bad example: http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/

    * Patagonia is the good example since it's a brand people trust, and their homepage is immediately trusting since it shows people wearing the brand in realistic outdoor situations.  There's also a noticeable "Shop" button in the middle of the page for easy navigating.  The author, Suzanne Collins (_Hunger Games_ author) is the bad example because the site does not look very professional and makes you second guess whether or not you're on the legitimate page of someone who wrote such a popular book series.

## Copywriting
4. Does it reduce anxiety?
    * Good example: https://www.airbnb.com/
    * Bad example: https://www.aquariumrestaurants.com/downtownaquariumdenver/

    * Airbnb is the good example since the homepage is very simple and tells the user exactly what to do.  It reduces the anxiety associated with information overload and decision fatigue.  The Denver Aquarium is the bad example because it has a dark background with bright neon text and a lot of buttons to read through and click. Some of the text links are bold, while others are not.  It's not easy to follow, and does not reduce anxiety.

## Analysis
5. How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
    * Good example: https://denvermicrobrewerytours.com/
    * Bad example: https://www.art.yale.edu/

    * Denver Brewery Tours is the good example because their site is simple and to the point. The analysis of their UX can be measured and set with clear goals. Examples of useful things to measure would be clicks on the book now button, length of time people are staying on the site, or are people interested in events? Yale Art School is the bad example since everything is all over the place.  It's difficult to define a clear goal and what to measure.  Should people be coming to the site for the novelty aspect or to actually apply? With the current setup, it would be hard to analyze real numbers through all the other noisy data.
