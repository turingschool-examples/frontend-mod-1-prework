# Day 7 Exercises

## Psychology
### What habits are created if they do this over and over?

  - Youtube is a good example of repeatable behavior. To work with the promotion algorithm channels are encouraged to post daily. This also has the effect of providing fresh content for users on a consistent basis. They know they can come back each day or on a repeatable basis to watch a new video from their favorite creator and can build a habit on that.

  - I think this site represents the inverse. Without a clear indication when new content is available, it's tough to know when to come back. They combat this with a mailing list, but the variable schedule does not encourage strong habit formation.

## Usability
### Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

  - James Clear with a book on habit formation tries to encourage users to build strong habits. Part of his breakdown of this is environment design and accessibility. If you were looking for articles from him, you simply navigate to the articles page and can see all his most recent articles listed by date.

  - While the forest service website has some very valuable resources from the user. It is often a slog to get to them. You'll have to click through a series of non-intuitive links and hope you guessed correctly to find what you're after. It could be designed more effectively with a restructuring.

## Design
### Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know?
- https://www.ted.com/#/
  - The Ted website opens clearly onto TED recommends, talks TED has chosen as valuable in a range of topics. It allows a user to get engaged quickly right at the center of the page from the get go. This removes any barrier to entry.

  - The MTA, the transit authority of New York serves as a good before and after of design improvement. Previously their site had too many options, it did not clearly lead the user anywhere or give them anything concrete to focus on. They've recently come into funding and have been attempting to remedy this which can be seen at https://new.mta.info/

## Copywriting
### Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
 - https://www.memrise.com
  - Memrise clearly states the mission statement of the company, what it means for the user, and provides them some context on it without being overly verbose.

- https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/
  - I feel the ultimate guitar website is inconsistent in it's messaging. They have lots of advertisement, for other services and their own. They're trying to offer lots of different functionality displayed in a ton of places on their website, and it leads to it all feeling cluttered and unfocused.

## Analysis
### Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
- https://thewirecutter.com/
  - Product choices are to an extent, inherently subjective. However people are generally seeking honest reviews, which can be hard to find online. The wirecutter has a very methodical approach to it's product reviews, one that attempts to mitigate the subjectivity.

  - Many multi-level marketing schemes are the inverse of this. While perhaps effective, they deliberately try to exploit personal connections rather than focusing on the product or clear effective honest marketing.
