## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)

1. What is UX?
* UX is commonly referred to as "User Experience", but as the article suggests, UX is actually about "doing" the process of User Experience Design.  The process involves doing research to understand the users, developing ideas to solve the users’ needs — and the needs of the business — and building and measuring those solutions in the real world to see if they work.

2. What are user Goals & Business Goals?
* User Goals equate to what the user wants out of the site or app.

* Business Goals are the organizations reasons for creating a site or app in the first place. Typically, it’s money, but it might be brand awareness, or getting new members for a community, etc.

3. What are the 5 Main Ingredients of UX?
* The 5 Main Ingredients of UX are Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting & Analysis.

*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.
* Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your `day7-exercises.md` file.

1.  Psychology: Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
* Good Site: https://www.gowesty.com/ Right off the bat the site has a visual slide show of a roundup of new products, specials and suggestive content.  There are pictures everywhere that get me excited about this passion of mine.  

* Bad Site:  https://www.rockauto.com/  I've always felt like the way this site is set up to find a part is more complicated than it should be.  I definitely feel, that on the back end of things it's probably set up this way for their ease of use. It not fun to search for a part you need on this site, it's way too much work.  

2.  Usability: Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
* Good Site: https://www.amazon.com/  There's really not a whole lot of explanation here.  Obviously Amazon has figured it out.  It is so easy to find what you want.  

* Bad Site:  https://www.rockauto.com/  It not fun to search for a part you need on this site, it's way too much work. It's literally like you're clicking on 50 directories before you get to the file you want.

3. Design: Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
* Good Site:  http://www.t3technique.com/  Visually you can see that this page offers specific parts.  It's small and leads you right to a select few parts that it specializes in. Yes there are words, but you don't need them.  Just click on the image to get what you need.

* Bad Site:  https://www.thesamba.com/vw/  While at first glance, it's obvious this is a VW specific site, however, it does very little to communicate its real benefits.  The home page clearly has a focus on classified ads, but you have to dig deeper to find the real meat and potatoes which are the resources that tell you all you want to know about a particular vintage VW.

4.  Copywriting:  Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
* Good site:  http://www.t3technique.com/  Again, this site's "Copywritting" hit's it out of the park through design.  Because of the way it is designed it's clear, direct, simple and functional in getting what you want.

* Bad Site:  https://www.rockauto.com/  This site made my bad list again.  It's not clear nor simple on how you should navigate the site to find the part that you need.  

5.  Analysis:  How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
* Good site: https://www.facebook.com/  I'll use the ad feature on FB as an example.  You have options on your feed that allow you to offer feedback on the ads.  In that feedback you are given a few basic choices about removing the ad and why.  

* Bad Site:  https://www.facebook.com/ I will simultaneously put FB in the bad category in this regard. Users don't get to choose the algorithm that creates their news feed.  So often users don't see what's going on with certain friends while most of the time they'll see an abundance of just a few of their friends.
