User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX):

1)Psychology - How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
[Good:](https://www.instagram.com/)
It's a bit basic in the worst sense of the word but Instagram's sites gets you exactly to what are wanting (browsing pictures endlessly) very simply, quickly, smoothly.

[Bad:](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/unemployment)
From first hand experience I can tell you how convoluted this website as a whole is to navigate to reach your end goal, applying for unemployment. There are pages with information that only gets you so far in the process and then fails to direct you towards the next hoop to jump through. It overall takes **alot** of work to get anywhere, and I still needed to call in to figure it out.  


2)Usability - If the user doesnâ€™t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?
[Good:](https://www.airbnb.com/)
To me airbnb is an excellent example of a site that just makes sense, even when you first use it. You're welcomed with a form immediately with all the information you want and need to provide to get the service you want. Once redirected, I believe it continues to be very clear-cut once you're on the main site, and transversing it is a breeze.

[Bad:](https://denver.craigslist.org/)
Saying that Craiglist is a bit daunting and confusing when you open it up for the first time is an understatement. This only gets worse as you click on particular category and are jolted into the unknown of how to post/ who posted what/ is it still available/ etc etc. This is why I would say that this site doesn't make sense without first 'reading the fine print'.  


3)Design - Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
[Good:](https://www.fourseasons.com/newyork/?seo=google_local_nyf1_amer)
I have never stepped foot into the Four Seasons in NYC but simply from their amazing site design I trust that this can and will deliver, and also break my bank.

[Bad:](http://sushibasho.com/)
Though this is one of my all time favorite sushi restaurants in Colorado (I'm talking great food and a killer price here!) but their website is very poorly designed. Yes it gets it's point across, and yes I can order what I want with ease, but the visual aspect of it is down right sad. If you had never been there before and this was your first impression you would probably have a hard time trusting the restaurant as a whole... and don't even get me started on it's color scheme.


4)Copywriting - Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
[Good:](https://www.grammarly.com/?q=brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand_f1&utm_content=76996511046&utm_term=grammarly&matchtype=e&placement=&network=g&gclid=CjwKCAiAu9vwBRAEEiwAzvjq-xbstKPcN8SJz6mldQxcn5yoM0mR9RnFQv12xe6cOaSUAxCrq3DiZBoCKycQAvD_BwE)
Grammerly is an incredible site when it comes to copywriting. Its concise and descriptive homepage copy (which is all you'll need for this site) to guide users along seamlessly making it, almost, ridiculously easy to use.

[Bad:](https://denver.craigslist.org/)
I would say Craiglist makes the list again for this example as well. The copy on the home page, and especially once you delve deeper into the site, is anything but clear or direct and some even without function at all. Random wording or special character run rampant on this site and so does confusion and frustration.


5)Analysis - Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
[Good:](https://www.dollskill.com/)
This site has always impressed me with how they handle mishaps and shake ups on the site, with orders, and products. They own their mistakes, learn from them, implement fixes and grow as a whole. 

[Bad:](https://breezyswimwear.com/)
This site was the bane of my existence awhile back. There was no info on the site on how to reach out to any customer service other than an email address. This email address went unanswered again, and again, and again. It became very apparent that this company was not in the business of taking complaints on an order or about the lack of accessibility on the site as a whole. Due to this blind eye to their bad results resulted in me never wanting to go back.
