After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

https://www.kohls.com/ everything feels like one step too many
https://www.walmart.com/ is also a bad example. i think its hard for a department store, they have a ton of product. its a bit overwhelming.

If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?

Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?

https://www.youtube.com/ is a good example. as soon as you open it up, you are put in position to be immersed in their content.
https://flyheight.com/ is a less good example. the quality of the content visually is distracting and makes you want to leave.

Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

https://www.flightclub.com/ you go there, you look, you buy shoes (when they're in the budget)
https://www.nicekicks.com/ not sure whether it is a store or news site.

Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?

https://www.instagram.com/ is both a good and bad example. they were thriving on allowing people a space to stroke their egos, but they are removing that function. they will suffer.
