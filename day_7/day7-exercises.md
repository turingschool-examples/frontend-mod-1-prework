## PSYCHOLOGY
# What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?

SUPPORTS: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/ In this case, the user’s motivation would be to download, or learn more information about Final Fantasy XIV. The website covers both of these desires with large, difficult to miss factoids about the game, autoplaying videoclips with scenes of story and gameplay that do not have autoplaying audio which could be offputting to a visiting user, and a download link at both the top and the bottom of the page just in case a user wants to begin their download without reading through game information.

VIOLATES: http://arngren.net/ - While the website is in another language, visually it is clear to see that something went terribly wrong in the design of this page. The website appears to be geared toward the purchase of ATV’s remote control drones and other motorized devices, but the page is filled with such chaos, I could not imagine those that actually speak the language  being able to find what they need easily at all.

## USABILITY
# Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?

SUPPORTS: https://catbox.moe/ - This file upload website is simple and functional, minimizing the risk of user confusion or error by minimizing the amount of steps a user has to take to achieve their end goal. Clicking the box in the center of the screen opens the users file folders, allowing them to choose what they want, before the website takes care of the rest for them and provides them with a link to their file that is auto-copied upon clicking.

VIOLATES: http://www.book-ends.com/ - Initially, the website appeared to be bland and unfinished with a poor layout, but not outright bad. However, that all changed once I began scrolling. The decision to put images of hundreds upon hundreds of book covers, all varying sizes and none of which can be clicked on is baffling. This could’ve been vastly simplified by including an input bar allowing users to search for books by Author, Title, or Category (Genre, Fiction/Non-Fiction, etc.).

## DESIGN
# Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

SUPPORTS: https://www.twitch.tv/ - The aesthetic of Twitch works well for the product they provide, allowing for users to quickly find their game of choice, the top streamers for that game, and featured streams on the main page.

VIOLATES: http://www.pnwx.com/ - The website appears to be geared toward the purchase of radiology equipment, however it seems amateurish with its poor color scheme and difficulty to read. While the option to purchase thousands of dollars worth of equipment is evident when delving deeper into some of the pages, the overall look of the website does not inspire confidence in believing that this is a safe place to enter your credit card information.

## COPYWRITING
# Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

SUPPORTS: https://www.facebook.com/ - Facebook is effective at everything it aims to deliver, with a minimalistic design, chat functionality available on all pages, customizable shortcuts, and an in-depth search bar.

VIOLATES: http://www.gatesnfences.com/ - This website is anything but simple, direct, and clear. The navigation on left the side of the page eliminates the point of categorizing anything as everything is already laid out without the need to click on any of the headers. This also forces the page to be much longer than it needs to.

## ANALYSIS
# Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?

SUPPORTS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page - Wikipedia, while debated as an untrustworthy source since articles can be changed by anyone (although these changes are usually deleted shortly thereafter), Wikipedia provides notable accolades as well as controversy to paint a clear and complete picture of the articles subject.

VIOLATES: https://www.eventhubs.com/tiers/ - EventHubs provides analytics for player determined tiers of characters in fighting games. While this data could be helpful in deciding which character qualifies as “Top Tier” and which could be considered bad characters, it does not provide any information as to how gains or losses in tiers are provided. Is it user voted? Is it determined by tournament placing? Is it decided by the purveyors of the website itself? Insight into how this list is populated could lend weight to the accuracy of the Tier Charts.
