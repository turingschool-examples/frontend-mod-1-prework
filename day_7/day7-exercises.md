**What is UX?**

  UX design is a process by which you research to understand users, develop ideas to solve their needs alongside the needs of the business, and build, measure your solutions in the real world to see if they actually meet those needs.

**What are User Goals & Business Goals?**

  User goals are the needs of the user when interacting with your product or service. The business goals are measurable metrics they aim to achieve in order to maintain and grow their business. These goals need to be aligned in order for UX to work appropriately.

**What are the 5 Main Ingredients of UX?**

1. **Psychology** - Subjective thought and feelings of the user.
1. **Usability** - How easy is it to achieve the need of the user on this website?
1. **Design** - How it works.
1. **Copywriting** - UX copy is direct and limits barriers to use.
1. **Analysis** - Testing, learning and optimizing.

<h1>Examples of Supportive and Violating UX Practices</h1>

Supportive Example: [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)

Violating Example: [Secret Escapes](https://us.secretescapes.com/?affiliateReg=us&affiliateUrlString=us)

**"What is the user's motivation to be here in the first place?"**

Airbnb

User's visit Airbnb in order to find unique vacation rentals. Their homepage helps accomplish this as quickly and painlessly as possible by keeping it remarkably simple. It only consists of a search function and nav bar. The search function is "above-the-fold" and centered in the top-left quadrant, so that it is likely the first object to be viewed.

Secret Escapes

Users visit Secret Escapes with the same motivatoin as Airbnb. This website's homepage immediately deters you from viewing their content or search for lodging by hitting with you a required "pop-up" requesting that you join their email list and share your Google or Facebook information before even having had a chance to familiarize yourself with their offerings. To make things worse, this is a required feature, meaning you can not view their homepage without it. This is the worst kind of barrier and I expect their bounce rate to be very high.

**Could you get the job done with less input from the user?**

Airbnb

Airbnb only requires that you fill out three field before submitting your search query. Location, dates and number of guests. They have minimized the number of steps in getting you started with you search to the very bare minimum. Leaving you the option to further refine, after you have started.

Secret Escapes

Secret Escapes requires you to log-in and share your information before you ever get to view their lodging options. Clearly their motivation is not to sell lodging, but instead their first priority is to gather and likely sell your information. This is a classic case where the user's needs and the business need's are not in alignment.

**Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?**

Airbnb

This is my personal opinion and I do not pretend to know what goes through anyone else's mind, but I would venture to say the minimal approach and serene background image really quiets the mind of the user and illicit trust.

Secret Escapes

Secret Escapes accomplishes the exact opposite, by loading the homepage as if you can use it and as soon as you begin scrolling, they lose your trust by hiding their content and asking for you information.

**Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?**

Airbnb

Yes, the Airbnb homepage only contains one sentence of copy: "Book unique places to stay and things to do." This is very direct and clutter-free. It's also motivating, aligning with the reasons why the user came to the website in the first place.

Secret Escapes

No, the Secret Escapes homepage refuses to share with you it's content and immediately asks you for three different forms of contact information. This is not confidence inspiring. Beyond the pop-up, there are many tiles and carousels with tons of copy. It is overwhelming to establish sequence of information.

**Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?**

By providing users the ability to search without barrier, Airbnb is likely able to learn more about how users are attempting to use their website in non-converting visits. Helping Airbnb identify their opportunities for improvement. Secret Escapes likely never gets this opportunity because I am willing to assume most people bounce out without ever being able to interact with their homepage due to its barrier to entry.
