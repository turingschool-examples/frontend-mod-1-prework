1. Psychology
- What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?
    - medium.com I think does a good job of meeting the need of the user's motivation to being at their site. They immediately present the user with articles at the top about a variety of topics, then jump into the different subtopics as the user scrolls, with an aside section of the most popular articles at the time. There is also a thumbnail for most articles to give an idea of what the topic might be about.
    - cnn.com is pretty lack luster in motivating the user to look through articles. The majority of their articles are just headlines, without any indication of what each story is actually about. Each article also autoloads a video ad or video segment. This is counter to what I think the user wants, as I feel the motivation is to read the news rather than watch it.
2. Usability
- Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
    - Southwest.com is pretty good about working with user assumptions. It pre-populates departure airport and the upcoming weekend, and has travel advisory information listed at the top as well. I think this are positive UX assumptions
    - Netflix.com has an awful auto-preview player that will start playing a trailer or clip of anything you hover over. I don't think taking up bandwidth and auto playing anything is positive design. You are assuming the user wants to see a trailer rather than giving an option. I think this works against the user.
3. Design
- Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
    - Mint.com does a good job of showing you what the application is good for right upfront. At a glance they show images of account aggregations and financial information, and with only reading headers you can see it is about budgeting and financial aggregation.
    - As much as I think it is useful, the dndbeyond.com website looks like just another community news website, rather than the wealth of resources it actually is. You have to start navigating the dropdowns in the nav bar before you start to see much resourceful related to what the website is actually useful for.
4. Copywriting
- Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
    - Again, I go to Mint.com with the way they have 3 tiles showing 3 big financial items (All accounts in one place, Budgeting, and Credit Scores). The one-line blurbs about each topic are well written as well, telling you what you can do and what they provide.
    - spirithalloween.com is a pretty bad example. They automatically load your location with closest store new you, but the actual information about the company and website is way down below in a block of long text.
5. Analysis
- Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
    - Fidelity.com I think does a good job of presenting data in a way to learn the current stock trends as accurately as possible.
    - Reddit.com I think is good at proving whatever post is "right" rather than looking at the truth. Their algorithm pushes highly voted items to the front page, but that doesn't mean they are truthful or accurate.
