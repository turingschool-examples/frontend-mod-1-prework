1. Psych: How does this make them feel?
* Skillcrush has a feminine feeling. The colors and vibe are lighter. I was attracted to it to learn to code, but my boyfriend
was not.
* Recovery Cafe Longmont has a warm and welcoming feeling. I like the color scheme and find it to be warm while still
discussing darker topics.

2. Usability: Are you working with the userâ€™s assumptions, or against them?
* The volunteer page on the RCL site is confusing. Which form do I use to apply to volunteer?
* Skillcrush was very well-laid out.

3. Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
* I trust the organization is real, but they don't update their website very often based the information.
* Skillcrush and Recovery Cafe Longmont looks updated and I trust it's legitimate.

4. Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
* Recovery Cafe DC does not list their operating hours in their calendar.
* RCL's volunteer and donate tab is small and in the corner. It'd take some scanning to find it.

5. Analysis: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
* The calendar on the RCD page proves they don't update their website.
* Skillcrush lists lots of stats and numbers so they user can make an informed decision.
