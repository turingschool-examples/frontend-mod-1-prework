## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)
- [x] Read the first three posts of "UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals"

1) Psychology
 * Question: How does this make them feel?
  * Supports: https://alchemy365.com/ the website makes me feel energized and excited to work out.
  * Violates: http://www.crossfitsurge.com/ when I stumbled on this website when researching new gyms to join in my area, I immediately felt stressed by the aggressive feel and vibe of the website. Even though the colors are the same as the other gym, the overall feel that this website has leaves me feeling anxious and overwhelmed.

2) Usability
  * Question: Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
    * Supports: https://uigradients.com/#Pizelex tells you as the page loads how to nagivate and use it
    * Violates: https://www.colorcodepicker.com/ I was initially very confused by this website and how to use it.

3) Design
  * Question: Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
    * Supports: https://nomnompaleo.com/ the cartoons, font, use of "nom", and colors all do an excellent job at being consistent and reminding the user of the "Nom Nom Paleo" brand. Anything of Michelle Tam's is instantly recognizable.
    * Violates: http://www.crossfitwashpark.com/ navigating around this site, I'm not even sure what their brand is. You could easily even forget that this is a website for a gym. It feels very apparent that no thought went into the brand.


4) Copywriting
  * Question: Does it reduce anxiety?
    * Supports: https://www.nytimes.com/ delivers the top headlines in a way that doesn't make me feel anxious when scrolling through their website.
    * Violates: https://www.cnn.com/ is very aggressive in it's headline delivery approach which makes me feel anxious.


5) Analysis
  * Question:Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?
    * Supports: https://www.amazon.com/ Amazon has always done a great job at learning about it's users to suggest relevant and useful products.  
    * Violates: https://www.yelp.com/ Yelp doesn't seem to take it's users data and make relevant suggestions. Even though they are primarily a search and review tool, when making searching I'd like recommended places to appear that align with previous searches/etc. versus just delivering sponsored information.
