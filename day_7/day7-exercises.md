**User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)**


1. **Psychology**

- How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

*positive*
https://www.amazon.com/
Amazons website flows smoothly. It does not take a lot of time to find what you want and psychologically makes you want to buy more than what you came on there to but. It is incredibly efficient.  
*negative*
http://www.roverp6parts.com/
This website is a jumbled mess and at the first glance of it I get completely lost by everything that is going on. I would have to work extremely hard to get what I wanted out of the website.

2. **Usability**

- Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?

*positive*
https://us.camposcoffee.com/
This website upon entering gives me a clear and direct information on what they are selling and how to buy what they are selling. 
*negative*
http://act.mit.edu/cavs/
This website really tries to be very clever and in their attempt, they end up being super indirect and confusing.

3. **Design**

- Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

*positive*
https://www.onnit.com/
When I look at there website, it looks well put together and very clean. It is easy to find what I am looking for.
*negative*
https://www.riversideartcenter.org/
The first glance of this website does not look good to me, from the colors to the layout. I do not trust what they are trying to tell me.

4. **Copywriting**

- Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?

*positive*
https://workstack.io/
The biggest text in this website clearly portrays what they are all about. `Team planning made easy`
*negative*
http://www2.pnwx.com/
While observing this website, I do not believe that the most important text is the biggest text and creates confusion when trying to look for what you are looking for.

5. **Analysis**

- How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?

*positive*
https://mediadistribution.espn.com/
I would measure this website by the information they are portraying and if they are a credible source for knowing what they are talking about. In this case they are measuring sports and I believe they are doing a great job at it.
*negative*
http://www.gatesnfences.com/
I would measure this by the complexity of text and the disorganization of what they are trying to tell me.
