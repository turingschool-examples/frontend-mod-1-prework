What is UX?
User Experience. The process of UX Design.

What are User and Business goals?
To make Users Effective. Users want to do something, not always productive. Businesses want "metrics" or "KPI's". The business benefits when the user reaches their goals.

The 5 main ingredients:
1. Psychology: What do they expect when they click this? Reddit.com has straightforward subs and links. Many news sites (washingtonpost.com) have a lot of 'clickbait' ads and misleading links.
2. Usability: Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever? Toyotanation.com provides straightforward information, whereas many local dealership websites are almost intentionally vague.
3. Design: Does it represent the brand? Does it feel like the same site? Again, Toyotanation.com is very fluid and consistent with their info/links. And again, many local dealership sites are intentionally vague. A "Toyota" dealer site will often link to different brands in order to get a sale as quickly as possible.
4. Copywriting: Does is reduce anxiety? Wiki.com will explain (mostly) unbaised information about whatever subject is being researched. WebMD gives the worst news about a topic right away, causing unneeded stress. "OMG DO I HAVE THIS??"
5. Analysis: Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements? Linustechtips.com is always seeking to improve. The Verge and Forbes.com seem to only care about the numbers.
