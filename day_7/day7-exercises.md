## Psychology
# __How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?__
* amazon.com does a 'great' job of anticipating what a user is looking for (however intrusive their data collection policies are). When you visit your amazon homepage, little work is required to find your order history, prime video options, or the search function to order next months supply of coffee filters. The amount of work required for a user to get what they need is minimal. (www.amazon.com)
* I've always found reddit.com's search function to be infuriating. Let's say you come across an interesting article about some obscure topic, and then two months later the topic comes up while you're out to dinner with your friends. In order to search reddit you would need to either remember which subreddit you were visiting or the exact name of the post from two months ago. It's not impossible, but you do need to put in the work to find what you are looking for.(reddit.com)

## Usability
# __Could you get the job done with less input from the user?__
* airbnb.com does a good job of simplifying their booking options. They require a location, check in and out dates, and number of guests. This starts the initial search, and further information can be provided later to filter the results based on other search criteria.

* I've always felt that facebook.com is the worst website for this question. Of course they are using the information gathered to sell, which is why it seems like you could spend hours inputing your information and not complete your profile.

## Design
# __Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?__
* Zillow.com has a clean trustworthy design which stays on brand throughout the site.
* craigslist.com on the other hand, is probably the ugliest and least trustworthy looking site I can think of.

## Copywriting
# __Does it reduce anxiety?__
* forbes.com is an example of a site that utilizes good copy. It's clear, brief, and leaves the user anxiety free.

* https://www.art.yale.edu/ could be used for multiple questions here, but it's copywriting is confusing and it's hard to decipher the copy.


## Analysis
# __Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?__
* While managing a YouTube channel for two years, I dove headfirst into the analytics of the site. Once you understand a little about how and why users discover or watch a video on your channel, you can create strategies to drive more traffic based on topic, thumbnail, etc.

* Along the same lines, I found it much harder to decipher the analytics of content posted on Facebook. Views are counted differently therefore one view on Facebook isn't as 'valuable' as a view on Youtube.
