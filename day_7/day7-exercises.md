- Phycology: What do they expect when they click this?
 Good Website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ //As a user of this website and someone who is navigating it often. I always find what I
   expecting to see when I click "this".
 Bad Website: https://games.aarp.org/ //Navigating this website there were a lot of pop ups and ads that I had to navigate through before arriving
   at what it was I clicked on.

- Usability: Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
 Bad Website: https://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/ // I introduced this website to a few of my family and friends and they all had a difficult  
   time navigating the scroll features and it was so sleek that it made it hard to find links and other features of the website.
 Good website: https://turing.io/ // This website is clear and bold in all the right spots. Easy to navigate while being clever where it counts.

- Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
 Good Website: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/ // I love the look and what they have achieved it warms you up and draws you in from the second
   it downloads.
 Bad Website: https://www.amazon.com/ // It is overwhelming and there are adds already on the log in page it leads me to not trust it.

- Copywriting: Does it reduce anxiety?
 Bad Website: https://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/ // Again really to mush going on and so sleek and clean it becomes hard to use.
 Good Website: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/ // Again it is so simple to navigate, easy to read.

- Analysis: Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
 Good Website: https://www.bbc.com/news/world // The information on this website has proven to be that more of the time than not objective facts.
 Bad Website: https://www.cnn.com/ // The information on the website is one of many subjective opinions rather than objective facts.
