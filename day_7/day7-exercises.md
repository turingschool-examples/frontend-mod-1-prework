# Day 7 Exercises

## UI/UX

1.  The users motivation to be here is
    - https://simplychocolate.dk/ Chocolate. Enough said. This site is designed well and the scrolling input of the user makes the website more fun to use. 

    -   http://www.greatdreams.com/ although the reason behind the wob site is really thoughtfull and heartfelt, the execution falls really short. OThe message gets lost in bad design.

2.  Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
    - http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/ Does an amazing job of scrolling while still getting the information across. 

    - http://www.feedmusic.com/ I personally feel that "scroll jacking" is annoying unless it is done well. By spending so much input on scrolling that I lose intrest in the information/product they are trying to sell.


3.  Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
    -   https://www.guillaumetomasi.com/ This website uses the least amount of words possible to convey the message.

    -   https://techcrunch.com/2007/08/31/19-billion-words-scribd-is-catching-up-to-wikipedia/ The tech crunch web site has alot of busy-ness going on, the user almost loses track of the actual content, amd the reason of why you originally clicked on the website.

4.  Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional
    -   https://tejchauhan.com/ Is a perfect example of excelling at all of the adjectives in the question. 
    
    -   http://arngren.net/ Is the exact opposite of every adjective in the question. There is so much information going on and it looks horrible.

5.  How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
    -   By looking for bad results, it helps teach what not to do. This is more important than any other skill at web design. Having a mental image of bad. If a person can look at their own website through eyes of a consumer and get an unbiased result can be really helpful.
