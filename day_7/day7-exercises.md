## 1. Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

* Good Example: https://www.Amazon.com/ "Amazon". Amazon has become the go-to website for online shopping. Their homepage is a dynamic display of information. It's a mix of advertisements for the services they are increasingly providing, and the products that are for sale on their online marketplace. It is a site built on/for commerce, through and through; It understands that people visit the site to purchase products or get entertainment. It's design, is therefore, centered around creating a flawless/effortless buying experience.  

* Bad example: https://www.sos.state.tx.us/ "Texas Secretary of State Homepage". This is a government website, and like many in its class, it lacks in functionality and straightforwardness. It's a big office with many responsibilities, so it's understandable that organizing them can prove difficult. Just like in physical government offices, the website can be difficult to navigate to the place where you can be attend to your purpose there. It takes some time to learn the navigational matrix to where the information needed can be found. To their defense, they do offer some good starting points, but they are only starting points.   

## 2. Usability: Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?

* Good example: https://www.linkedin.com/ "LinkedIn". There is nothing fancy about LinkedIn's homepage. It's clear where to search for jobs, and requires only two fields to start the search. The results are displayed in two columns: on the first, one displays all the options that the search returned, on the second the user can see a brief description of the job posting currently selected and a link to further information. For those looking to post a job, those options are easily found with a quick scroll down the page.  

* Bad example: http://www.mrbottles.com/ "Antique Bottle Collectors Resource". This website is a little much, and it's purpose unclear. It has an unintuitive design, where bottles offer an opportunity to navigate the site but not a sense of direction. On the other hand, the navigation bar display common site options, but do not actually work. It's design tries to be clever but is too disorganized to accomplish such thing.   

## 3. Design: Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?

* Good Example: https://Apple.com/ "Apple". Apple is a perfect example of dedication to design. The brand culture was formed around having good design in every aspect of their products. Their website is no exception; it's an extension of the clean, modern design inherent in their products. Wether the user is new to Apple or a seasoned user, the website feels intuitive and inviting. It is no surprise their products garnish such popularity and have become status symbols.

* Bad example: https://www.art.yale.edu/ "Yale School of Art". Yale is a well known ivy school, so naturally one expects great things from it. The website for the School of Art is inconsistent with the school's main website, and in it's own internal style. On first impression, it is hard to believe the site is associated with such a well-regarded school. It takes a second to find a note on the side of the website to learn that the site is a collaborative project between faculty and staff. Even so, one would expect a better/more consistent design.       

## 4. Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

* Good Example: https://Google.com/ "Google". Google could be a good example for all these questions, but this question in a way sums up the rest. The Google homepage is nothing more than it needs to be, and the adjectives above all fit without requiring much explanation. It's main purpose is clear and succinct, it's use intuitive, and design friendly. It is no surprise the Google homepage has become the gateway to the internet.

* Bad Example: https://www.yahoo.com/ "Yahoo!". For comparison sake, let's use another capable search engine, Yahoo!. As opposed to Google, Yahoo doesn't neatly tuck away all it's additional functionalities in an intuitive corner for the user to access; instead, it has news, ads, mail, and a search bar in one page. Sure, it's still functional but the added information distracts from having one clear purpose.     

## 5. Analysis: Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

Given that this is a process, I think it is better illustrated not by websites, but trends in technology.

* Good example: The AI-based assistants that the biggest names in the tech industry have rolled out with, not only improve the usability of their products, but also offer the opportunity to gather user feedback. These products are in constant communication with their makers, allowing them to better tailor an experience to their users. It will be the information gathered through these products that drive the changes of the future, because companies will be better able to access the truths behind people's choices.     


* Bad example: Technology is a neutral force. The same technology that produces each of our unique experiences on the web can also keep us inside our neat closed-off information bubble. Big names in social media took heat after Russia meddled in the U.S. elections. Some people believed the social media conglomerates have taken pre-emptive action to prevent the spread of propaganda. This can be the topic of heated debate on the role technology/social media has on politics and culture in general, so it's easy to lose sight of one important fact: Both, we the users, and the companies failed at engaging in self-analysis. I believe this was a wake up call to many on how deeply engraved users can get within their information bubble to prove themselves right, and how social media has moved away from being platform predominately used to keep up with friends/family to becoming the main source of information about the state of the world consumed by a segment of the population.
