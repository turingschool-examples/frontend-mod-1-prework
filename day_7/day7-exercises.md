## Questions:

### What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
  * The UX is the user experience, and it involves making the use of websites and apps look better and preform better by programming them better.
  * User goals and business goals are both important to take in for the user experience (UX). You want both of these to align with what what purpose of the business is. The UX has to be positive enough for them to continue coming back, while also benefiting the business.
  * The 5 main ingredients to UX are psychology, usability, design, copywriting & analysis.
      1. Psychology: In a nutshell this is what the user wants or expects while using a certain site/app. And taking into account how they get what they want is part of it.
      2. Usability: This involves making everything on the user side as streamlined as possible. You don't want to the user getting frustrated and clicking off but you also don't want to make it so basic that it's not worth their while.
      3. Design:  This is related to how appealing the UX is. I often think of the company Glossier. As an Esthetician I know that their product ingredients are pretty basic and nothing special, but they are a company that has made a huge name for themselves just by looking appealing. They appeal to a large audience by their aesthetic and how they present themselves, which ties into how we design sites so that they user wants to come back.
      4. Copywriting: We have to remember that our goal isn't to push the company forward and support the image. As programmers our goal is to make sure that the actions of the user is preformed as directly and simply as possible.
      5. Analysis: This is very important because the ability to look at where the user is coming from, and their line of thinking is better practice than just assuming. Making adjustments for what you find out about the audience is crucial.

### After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.
<b>Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?</b>
<br />
Dating sites: <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">EHarmony</a> - This site might be good for some people but setting up a profile is a lot more difficult than using a site like <a href="http://www.hinge.com">Hinge</a>.
<br />
<b>Usability: Have you provided everything the user needs to know?</b>
<br />
<a href="http://www.deciem.com">Deciem</a> is a skincare company with a very visually appealing site. However, it's not a very user friendly site since the products sold are extremely confusing. The buyer has to do their own research outside of the site to understand what use the products have. On the other hand, a site with better usability that is comparable to Deciem is <a href="http://www.curology.com">Curology</a>. It's also a skincare site but it takes you through an interactive quiz that leads you to the right products specifically for you. Other examples of sites like this include <a href="http://www.prose.com">Prose</a>, <a href="http://www.esurance.com">Esurance</a>, and <a href="http://www.hellofresh.com">HelloFresh</a>.
<br />
<b>Designs: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?</b>
<br />
An example of a site that doesn't have the best design appeal is <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit<a/>. This is a site that doesn't really lead the reader anywhere but still is a successful site from a functionality aspect. A site whose design looks good and reliable would be <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, its similar to Reddit but has a better design layout.
<br />
<b>Copywriting: Does it reduce anxiety?</b>
<br />
A site that does a great job making a complicated and stressful thing like taxes easier is <a href="http://wwwe.turbotax.com">TuboTax</a>. A site that does not do a good job with relieving anxiety is <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/revenueonline">Department of Revenue</a>, paying business taxes on there is nothing but a hassle.
<br />
<b>Analysis: Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?</b>
<br />
<a href="http://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> is a site that knows what it's doing when it comes to understanding the user. Every part of the experience is customized by the persons behavior. Another example of this would be Youtube. A site that doesn't do the best at this would be <a href="http://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a>. Zillow is a great site that has made finding real estate much simpler for users. However, it gives users results based on what they are already looking for, rather than making suggestions based on analyzing past behavior.
