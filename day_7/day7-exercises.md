**How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?**
- https://www.barnesandnoble.com/
- https://www.tatteredcover.com/

Barnes and Noble makes it super easy to purchase books because they have a lot of titles featured on their home page. They also have all the genres listed at the top of the page making them easy to navigate. Tattered Cover's website makes the user work a little bit harder. Although there is a "shop" option in the main menu, you have to dig a little deeper to actually see books that are available to add to your cart.

**Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?**

On the Denver Public Library's website, the catalog search bar is front and center. It is very obvious to the user. On the Phoenix Public Library's website, the catalog search bar is a little farther down, a little smaller, and (very confusingly) right by the website search bar, which will return different results from the catalog search bar.

**Do the colours, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?**
- https://www.allbirds.com
- https://www.forever21.com/us/shop

I think the Allbirds website uses colors and shapes really well. The site has a very straightforward, clean design. Forever 21's website, in contrast, has way too much going on: pop-up windows, all sorts of different texts and a variety of colors make it hard to read.


**Does it reduce anxiety?**
- https://www.npr.org/
- https://www.9news.com/

NPR's website is really simple and easy to navigate. It is a stress-free website to browse. The 9News website, however, has a lot of ads, pop-ups, and fake news links that are very distracting and anxiety-inducing.


**Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?**
- https://www.epicurious.com/
- https://www.bonappetit.com/

I like that Epiicurious has a recipe search bar right at the top of their homepage. They know that users visit their site because they want to find a recipe to cook. I think people probably visit Bon Appetit's site for the same reason, yet recipes are not the main feature of their homepage.
