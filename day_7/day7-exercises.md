UX Questions:

<ol>
  <li><b>How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?</b>

  https://www.google.com is a good example of the user having to do minimal work to return the results that they want. Simply enter a search term and browse related pages. https://www.expedia.com is an example of quite a bit of work being required for a user to achieve their goal.<br /><br>

  </li>
  <li><b>Could you get the job done with less input from the user?</b>

  At http://www.lasvegasjusticecourt.us/ some databases would be easier to search with the cmd+f shortcut rather than having to enter so much information into forms. It would probably be easier to have filters to narrow down an open directory of information a user is seeking. At https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html the only input that is asked for is feedback from the user and links are provided for users to easily navigate to information they need.<br /><br>

  </li>
  <li><b>Does the design lead the userâ€™s eyes to the right places? How do you know?</b>

At https://dmvnv.com the design is very busy and crowded so it can take a user a while to sift through the information to get where they want to be. At https://www.usbank.com/index.html the key login information is big and a user is drawn right to it.<br /><br>

  </li>
  <li><b>Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?</b>

At https://twitter.com/ it is very direct about how to sign up or login ands displays info very well. http://arngren.net/, on the other hand, is very arbitrary and indirect<br /><br>

  </li>
  <li><b>Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?</b>

https://www.facebook.com/, as I think goes without saying, is very good at analyzing and using user data. As you can tell from the homepage at http://www.greatdreams.com/ this site does not pay much attention to usability.
