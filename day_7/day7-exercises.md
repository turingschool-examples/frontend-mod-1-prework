Psychology - How does this make them feel?
good - https://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/ - clean, minimalistic, interactive, visually appealing
bad - https://www.clothingshoponline.com/ - feels cheap, poor picture quality, 'reviews' and 'feedback' button are annoying and block right/left arrows.

Usability - Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
good - https://offerup.com/ - easy to navigate, find what you're looking for, modern and intuitive.
bad - https://denver.craigslist.org/ - personally I always get lost trying to find something on craigslist. It's hard to read text because of color and letter spacing is too small. Layout is not bad, but could use common and modern styling.

Design - Do the colors, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?
good - https://fi.google.com/about/ - nicely incorporated google brand colors, clean background, common font and good line and letter spacing.
bad - https://www.art.yale.edu/ - it looks like it was created by 7yr old.

Copyrighting - Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
good - https://monday.com/ - You can get idea what you would get in one quick scroll, animations and visuals makes it even more clear.
bad - https://www.esurance.com/ - Too many words 'save', 'affordable', it doesn't look trustworthy.

Analysis - How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
good - https://www.alternativeairlines.com/norwegian - All information passenger might be looking for is listed at the same page(just need to scroll down), nothing is hidden, it saves  many clicks.
bad - https://www.ryanair.com/us/en - It takes too long to find necessary information and they try to sell something you don't need at every step.
