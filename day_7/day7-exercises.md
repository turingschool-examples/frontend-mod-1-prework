**Psychology**
What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place?

https://www.thespotgym.com
Interested in climbing or becoming a member here. The main text welcomes the user with "welcome to the spot" and in the button immediately below they ask "Ready for your first visit?". This satisfies the main two reasons someone might be on the site just at the first glance. Creating an easy and straight forward experience.

https://www.urbanautocare.com/
Looking for help with a car repair. The entire main page just describes them as trust worthy and encourages the user to click a learn more button that takes you to more information about the team of mechanics. This should be switched with the schedule service button in the top right.

**Usability**
Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

https://www.amazon.com/
No. Amazon has a search bar and a drop down menu beside it with basically every category needed for the user to input their search and quickly find what they are looking for. Thus, making it very simple for the user to input as little information as possible to find exactly what they need.

https://www.urbanautocare.com
Yes. Just have the main page be the form for schedule an appointment.

**Design**
Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

https://turing.io/
Yes. It represents what the brand does well and easily flows to the information the user may be looking for.

http://autorepairgreeley.com/
No. It is terribly put together and hard to look at. It immediately tries to fight for your trust rather than functionally build it. Also, the site is FILLED with words nobody wants to read.

**Copywriting**
Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?

https://www.goarmy.com/
Yes. The biggest text is the most important here because it provides exactly what the Army wants you to do and gets things done directly and simply as possible for the user.

http://autorepairgreeley.com/
No. In this case the biggest text is challenging the user to do way more than what they are on the site for, rather than just setting up simple appointment to fix their car.

**Analysis**
Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?

The intro paragraph gives a stat saying residents fail to recycle the right things. Then follows up with the information to help solve it later down the page.

States that it is the worlds largest shoe store but has absolutely no proof. Also does not even show a picture and price of a shoe that can be purchased there.
