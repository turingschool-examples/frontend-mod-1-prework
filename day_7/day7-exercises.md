# Day 7: Create a Site for Show and Tell! Also, UI/UX and Submit Your Module 0 Capstone.

## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Questions and Answers

*   There is a great series of UI/UX posts called [UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals](http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals). Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.
* Answers:

* **Psychology**
  * Question:  How does this make them feel?
    * Supporting Site: [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Great site for beginners, there is a link right on the top of the page for beginners that immediately gets them going and doesn't overwhelm them.  Each task builds on the last, keeping the user going towards a goal.  You also get immediate feedback on each page.
    * Violating Site:  [USTA-National Tennis Site](https://www.usta.com/en/home.html) If a tennis player wants to say, look up rules for their section, it will take them quite some time on this site.  There are too many moving parts as the site is choppy with lots of unnecessary confusing heading and pictures. I feel overwhelmed with this site and quickly want to leave.

* **Usability**
* Question:  Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
    * Supporting Site:  [Southwest Airlines](https://www.southwest.com/) The Southwest site comes with your city location, passenger number, and flight dates pre-filled.  While it's likely that the user will change the flight dates, the other two fields have a high probability of being correct.
    * Violating Site: [Frontier Arlines](https://www.flyfrontier.com/)  It's very similar to the southwest site, but they require the user to fill in dates and though the location is pre-filled, if you happen to click in it, then the pre-filled location disappears and it starts with an alphabetical list of cities.  Plus, if you accidentally scroll over the menu items on the top, a new window pops up to completely cover the book a flight feature.  In short, there's a higher likelihood of the user having to jumble a few more things on this site.

* **Design**
  * Question:  Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
    * Supporting Site: [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) It's a simple look, but professional and on first glance, has the appearance of being easy to navigate, which it is.
    * Violating Site:  [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Though I like the feeling that this site gives me, I think the design leaves a lot to be desired.  This site was a recommendation from a Turing alum, but at first glance, the site looks rather basic and lacks some professionalism.  I didn't trust it immediately and only stayed on it because of the recommendation. I'm glad I did give it a chance, but I'm not sure I would have without the personal recommendation.

* **Copywriting**
  * Question: Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
    * Supporting Site:  [Denver Zoo](https://www.denverzoo.org/) The largest text on the site is a one-line saying with a link to buy tickets.  Buying tickets is probably in the top 3 of reasons why people may visit the site.
    * Violating Site: [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/) This is interesting because the biggest text on the page is two phrases ("Say Yes to You" and "Oh Hello again") that appear to be trying to talk to you.  They each have a 'learn more' link that takes you to the same location to order some not-so-healthy drinks.  The important info (sign in, gift card, find a store) has smaller text but is at the top of the page.

* **Analysis**
  * Question: Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
    * Supporting Site: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/).  Yelp allows users to leave feedback on a myriad of items: Hotels, Restaurants, Home Services, Delivery, and more.  Users leave a 1-5 star rating, all based on personal experience.  The feedback is all subjective, but when compiled with other user feedback as a larger whole, a pretty accurate picture is painted of an organization.
    * Violating Site:  [National Public Radio(NPR)](https://www.npr.org/) NPR stopped allowing readers to comment on articles in 2016 because they felt that too many users were trolling and had hijacked the article.  While there is still a method of feedback NPR provides (you can email them), they no longer have public posts in an effort to keep the reader more focused on the article.
