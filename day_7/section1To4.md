# Section 1: Super Learners

### Reflect:

1. What do you already do?
  - To exercise my mind I usually play games. I feel like while I’m playing games I’m really focused on small details, my mind comes up with different ideas of playing. I know I’m not improving my learning skill much as I’d if I’m reading books but it helps me clear my mind. When I learn something new and interesting I usually share with my friends as well. I love reading about different fun facts and share them with my friends.

2.  Does this make you want to do anything new or different as you begin this learning journey?
  - Yes, it does. Knowing most of the successful people reading so many books makes me want to get into habit of reading books as well. If I read books I believe I will be able to improve my English grammar and vocabulary as well.


# Section 2 - Asking Questions

### Reflect:

1. How you feel about asking questions? (specifically, the technical question as you enter your technical work at Turing)
  - When I don't know the team well I hesitate to ask questions at first. I'm still learning English, I get worried if I'm going to hold the entire class when I ask questions.  Because if I'm not able to clearly ask questions then we will spend half of the time trying to figure out what I'm trying to ask. After I feel comfortable with the team, I usually find myself asking lots of questions. This is the first time I have ever felt so passionate about studying so, I'm sure I will be asking lots of questions during my time here at Turing. I've been learning different coding terms to help me able to ask questions clearly as well.

2. How might this positively or negatively impact your growth?

  - I feel like at first, it will negatively impact my growth if I hesitate to ask questions at the beginning because I will miss out on a lot of stuff that could help me build a foundation for what I'm learning. If I start asking questions after we finish basic fundamentals then I feel like it will hold me back from learning more. Because I am aware of my weakness I've been working on being more confident. I was asking questions and answering quite often during our Mod 0 sessions as well. After reading the blog about asking better questions, I'm going to start asking one question at a time and try to make my questions structured. I will try to figure out when is the right time to ask questions in the different scenarios as well.  One thing that really stood out to me from reading the blog about questions being dumb is if I hesitate to ask questions thinking it's dumb then I will never learn anything. Either I have to google and try to find the answer or ask someone for help. It better to ask questions than a waste of time.


# Section 3 - Growth Mindset

### Reflect:

1. What are two points from the article or video that either resonated with you or were brand new to you?
  - Practicing to set S.M.A.R.T goals were brand new to me. Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timebound will help understand code better. Instead of trying to do the entire project at once, the process of completing the project will go a lot smoother if I break my projects into different sections and set goals, and have a due date for them. This will motivate me to complete the work and I will utilize my time efficiently as well.  Another importance of having a growth mindset to develop my coding skills is by working to improve my skills and knowledge that’s inside my repertoire. I learned that instead of worrying about having to learn something completely new, I should first focus on what's I can learn that I've some knowledge on and will push my limit.

2. In which ways do you currently, demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you not?
  - By understanding the mistakes, after I get help, is my way of currently demonstrating a Growth Mindset. If I don’t understand anything or get stuck while coding I tend to Google a lot. I use multiple sites/resources to get my answers. After I know what my answer is I try to understand why that is my answer and also I try to see if there's any other way to get to that specific answer using the knowledge that I already know of. I have never set S.M.A.R.T goals while working on projects or anything. I believe I have always rushed to finish the projects as soon as possible instead of breaking everything into different sections and try solving it.

3. What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?
  - Now, I'm good at googling and comparing the answer that I find on different sites. I gained these skills/knowledge during one of the Mod 0 sessions. It is still hard sometimes to remember different techniques to search for information in Google but using different techniques to search often has been helping me get used to it.


# Section 4 How You Spend Your Time

### Reflect:   

1. Have the time estimates matched up with your experience?
  - Yes, the time estimates matched up with my experience. I usually give myself 10-20mins to figure out the problem and solve it. If I don't then I either ask for help or move on to a different problem then I go back to the first problem at the end. Doing this has helped me finish my project under the estimated time.

2. When you sit down to start working, do you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish and in how much time? If so, how aligned is that to what actually happens?
  - Yes, I've been using S.M.A.R.T goals to complete different assignments. Because I know what I want to finish within a certain period of time I usually get my stuff done. Ofc there will be a time when I have to do lots of googling to figure out stuff which tends to make me go past over the estimated time but with my experience in coding I believe it's normal.

3. How do you work best - in 2 hour blocks, 4-hour blocks, etc? Do you take breaks regularly? Do you have a system to hold yourself accountable to taking breaks?
  - Since I learned about Pomodoro Technique I've been working really productively and getting my stuff done. Taking a break really helps me. I give myself breaks to use my phone, eat, and other kinds of stuff so when It's time for me to work I'm not thinking about them as I usually mute my phone and do extra kinds of stuff in my break.  I set a timer and if I don't give attention to my dog he will make me take a break as well.
