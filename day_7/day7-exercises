1.Psychology

What do they expect when they click this?

Good:
https://www.discuvver.com/
      Click the button, take me to a random site. Does exactly what I expect
Bad:
https://tiii.me/?ref=discuvver
      Click the button to find out the total run time of a tv show. I had no idea
      what this site was about when I first got there.

2.
Usability

Good:
Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
https://www.instructables.com/?ref=discuvver
Has sections for people to search without having a specific search they want.
Also has a search bar if someone is looking for something specific.


Bad:
https://columbineconcrete.com/
User has to do a lot of scrolling. The website looks nice, however the amount of
scrolling needed and unreadability from the scrolling content not popping up until
scrolled is kind of an eye sore. Over designed


3.Design

Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

Good:
https://www.bluerivercontracting.com/
Looks professional, short and simple, not overly designed.

Bad:
http://www.hoursof.com/?ref=discuvver
Website looks underdeveloped and not quite sure it exists in the first place.
I would just look at an establishments business hours on their own website.


4.Copywriting
Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?

Good:
https://www.flightradar24.com/34.83,-98.26/5
Pretty straightforward what this website is about.

Bad:
https://draftmap.com/?ref=discuvver
No idea what this is about. Have to read entire website



5.Analysis
Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?

Using data:
  https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/
  Uses actual accumulated data from a reliable resource



Using opinion (not data):
  https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-whistleblower-not-entitled-to-anonymity-hes-an-informant-acting-as-a-democratic-operative

  stupid fox new opinions with no data to back it
