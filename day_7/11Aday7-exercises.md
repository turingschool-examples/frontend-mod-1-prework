## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)
### There is a great series of UI/UX posts called **UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals**.
### Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.<br />
__After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of   these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.__<br />

Psychology:<br />
What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?
Personal growth and self-help, they want to learn from others how to improve on whatever it is they are doing, this site truly lends itself to that.<br />

While the motivation to come to websites like this is to shop, it doesn't make it clean and simple for the user, it is overwhelming, like too many ads to choose from and pics to look at.

<br />Usability:<br />
If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?  Yes it does. Supporting link: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us There are two main things that stand out -search bar for what you are looking for in your area/location. And articles specific to title of website and magazine.<br />


Violating link: https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites For as popular as it has been and is, it is still to me one of the most outdated, amateurish looking sites out there, its like one big list of words vertically and horizontally, a sea of uninteresting type and if you don't read the fine print you are lost.


Design:<br />
Does it communicate the purpose and function without words? Yes it does.

 This is one of the better ones for a stock photo site, done with taste and representing real talent from around the world.

Violating Link:
The __arngren__ website
It does not communicate function and purpose without words, it primarily communicates chaos its such a mess I dont even want to put the unsecure url up here.

Copywriting:<br />
Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
Yes it does. Literally when you go to the site it immediately has questions with pictures around your food choices and specific diet making it very easy to move forward in the use of the site, supporting link: https://www.yummly.com/

Violating link: https://www.art.yale.edu/
 No, even though it may think it looks/seems confident, it isn't, with ads and flashy blinking stuff and a long scroll through, doesn't assist the user in any kind of direction, or where to begin, a bit like being blindfolded and playing pin the tail on the donkey.

Analysis:<br />
How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
supporting link: https://codebeautify.org/ It is a website that does just that, it focuses on helping the user to improve at whatever kind of coding they are doing in whatever language. You enter the code and press a button and it validates your code whether it is correct or incorrect, if incorrect it gives you reason why line by line. This site is error focused. This kind of error analysis lends itself to improvements both on the site and I imagine any errors/corrections users might report or dispute. Site is very clean and clear, as it should be for the content it is dealing with.

While it is an effective site for its users, when something does go wrong I've heard nothing but negative stories for how the site handles or doesn't handle these problems which makes you wonder if they are handling or collecting data for improvements, like many big sites that are good at one thing, they don't tend to move beyond that one thing and the way they do that one thing.
