Full transparency, I googled both projects and found solutions for each:
• [https://codeburst.io/javascript-breaking-down-the-shortest-possible-fizzbuzz-answer-94a0ad9d128a]
• [https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.js].

 Though, I did make some minor tweaking to the provided codes in order to meet the requirements of the projects. Also, the first article offered additional resources to make sense out of different operators like % and || that I thought were pretty cool and useful.
