    <h1> Get Outside! </h1>

      <h3> By: Leigh Larson  </h3>

    <h3> The Great Outdoors </h3>
    <p> I have been an outdoorsy person all my life. When we visted my dad in his small town,
      he'd support us to run free as he did growing up. My brother and I went fishing, biking, swimming, exploring. We loved being outside.
    This love has never stopped. I lived in a tent for two months in Botswana studying wildlife during college. I climbed half of Mt Kilimanjaro.
  I have camped in the Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska by myself. I love all things outdoors and am constantly looking
for new adventures. </p>

    <h3> Future Trips </h3>
    <p> I have a few trips that I would love to take. I just want to travel and see the world! In no particular order, I'd like
    to see:
    <li>Great Pyramids </li>
    <li> Machu Picchu </li>
    <li>Every national park in USA </li>
    <li>Banff </li>
    <li>Antarctica </li>
     </p>
