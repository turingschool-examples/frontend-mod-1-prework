I did not see this step initially that is why it is being submitted after the due date.
I figured better late than never.

Create a function

Create an array that is the alphabet.

Clean up that array that is the alphabet, make it work upper, lower, spaces, whatever.

Create an output of that cleaned up array.

Create a loop in the function that finds a letter in the array, that finds a
letter that links to it based on a shift variable. For example, A shifted by 1
becomes B.  

Allow for the loop to "loop(hate to use that word twice)" back on the alphabet so
that if the shift variable takes you beyond the alphabet it can come back to the begining.

Collect all the found letters in the array that have been shifted and spit them back
out on the console line.
