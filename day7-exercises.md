## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)
<b>There is a great series of UI/UX posts called UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals. Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.</b>

After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: <strong>Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.</strong><br />

<strong>PSYCHOLOGY</strong><br />
What is the userâ€™s motivation to be here in the first place? To see inspiring/funny videos, to upload videos<br />

Violating link:
Not even interesting to look at and the main page scrolls on forever, they may think they have provided everything the user needs to know but its impossible to differentiate and navigate with ease. https://websitesetup.org/

<strong>DESIGN</strong><br />
Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?<br />

Violating link: ebay, shopping sites that have so many buttons, overwhelming amount of stuff to navigate and few do it really well.

<strong>COPYWRITING</strong><br />
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?<br /> Very, because they are trying to help and show people the truth about student loan debt and how to make consolidation and payback simple and affordable.

Violating link:
 www.craigslist.com
It is no longer up to date with the basics of being really clear, functional etc.<br />

<strong>ANALYSIS</strong><br />
How can you use this analysis to make improvements? They use everything they interact with, collect and research to improve their company and site for their employees and customers<br />

Violating link: www.craigslist.com Again they are just not current, doesnt seem like they are taking any feedback or doing analysis to fix or improve the site.
