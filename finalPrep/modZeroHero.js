// Challenge - See if you can follow the instructions and complete the exercise in under 30 minutes!

// Declare two variables - heroName AND specialAbility - set to strings

// Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
//   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses concatenation to include the heroName
//   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the specialAbility

// Declare two variables - power AND energy - set to integers

// Declare two variables - fullPower AND fullEnergy
//   fullPower should multiply your current power by 500
//   fullEnergy should add 150 to your current energy

// Declare two variables - isHuman and identityConcealed - assigned to booleans


// Declare two variables - archEnemies AND sidekicks
//   archEnemies should be an array of at least 3 different enemy strings
//   sidekicks should be an array of at least 3 different sidekick strings

// Print the first sidekick to your console

// Print the last archEnemy to the console

// Write some code to add a new archEnemy to the archEnemies array

// Print the archEnemies array to console to ensure you added a new archEnemy

// Remove the first sidekick from the sidekicks array

// Print the sidekicks array to console to ensure you added a new sidekick

// Create a function called assessSituation that takes three arguments - dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse
//   - dangerLevel should be an integer
//   - saveTheDay should be a string a hero would say once they save the day 
//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel

// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

//Test Cases
var announcement = 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
var excuse = 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
// assessSituation(99, announcement, excuse) > Should print - 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
//assessSituation(21, announcement, excuse) > should print - 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
//assessSituation(3, announcement, excuse) > should print - "Meh. Hard pass."

// Declare a new variable - scaryMonster - assigned to an Object with the following key/values
//   - name (string)
//   - smell (string)
//   - weight (integer)
//   - citiesDestroyed (array)
//   - luckyNumbers (array)
//   - address (object with following key/values: number , street , state, zip)


// Create a new class called SuperHero
// - Your class should have the following DYNAMIC values
//   - name 
//   - superpower
//   - age 
// - Your class should have the following STATIC values
//   - archNemesis, assigned to "The Syntax Error"
//   - powerLevel = 100
//   - energyLevel = 50 

// - Create the following class methods
//   - sayName, should print the hero's name to the console
//   - maximizeEnergy, should update the energyLevel to 1000
//   - gainPower, should take an argument of a number and INCREASE the powerLevel by that number

// - Create 2 instances of your SuperHero class
