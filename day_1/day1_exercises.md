1)The purpose of HTML code is to describe the structure of pages of a website using elements. These HTML elements utilize tags (One opening tag, and one closing tags) which help them to tell the browser the information placed between these two tags.

2)An HTML element is the structure as a whole; It includes both the opening and closing tags AS WELL AS the content (text/information). Where as tags are just an opening or closing entity. They, the tags, are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element.   

3) Attributes basically tell us more about the HTML elements. They provide additional information about the contents of a particular element using an attribute name and value. The attribute name is responsible for indicating what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. Where as the value is the information or setting for an attribute and the HTML element that follows.  

4) The head HTML element contains information about the page and this information is not shown within the main part of the browser window. Inside the head element you will usually see the title element. This title element is the contents you will see either in the top of a browser, above where you type in the URL of a page, or on the tab for that page. It is also not shown in the main part of the main browser window. This main browser window is where the body element comes in. Everything inside the body element is shown ask in this main body.

5) Viewing the source of a website is pretty easy. When in a particular site, using chrome, look for the View menu at the top of your browser. Once you have located that menu click on it to extend the drop down menu and on there hover over the Developer option. This will bring you to another drop down menu which you will find View Source at the top; click this option. A new window will open which contains the source code that was used to create that particular page.

6) Different HTML elements:
      - <h></h> is a heading element and is used to represent the Heading before the main text. It uses six "levels" that in return display the heading in different sizes. h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest.
      - <b></b> is a <b>Bold</b> element and it is used to make the text inside its brackets appear bold.
      - <i></i> is an <i>Italic</i> element and is used to make text inside of its brackets appear italic. This element is also used to represent a section of text that would be said in a different way from the other surrounding text. (i.e. technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, etc.)
      - <sup></sup> is a superscript element and is used to contain superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.
      - <sub></sub> is a subscript element and used to contain characters that should be read as subscript, such as the 2 in H<sub>2</sub>O.

7) An empty element is an element that does not have any words between an opening and closing tag. These empty elements only include one tag, an opening tag.

8) A semantic markup is a style of markup used to provide extra information to certain text that appears on your page. This extra information can be used by other programs such as screen readers and search engines. Some examples of when to use semantic markup would be when placing emphasis in a sentence, noting that something is a quotation, the meaning of an acronym, etc. This type of markup is not intended to affect the structure of a web page.

9)  The new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5 are:
    - The header now sits in a new <header> element instead of <div id="header"
    - In addition to the new header element there is also the <footer> element as well. Where as the <header> element is used to contain the site name and the main navigation, the <footer> element contains the copyright information.
    - Another new element introduced is the <nav> or navigation element. This is used to contain the major navigational blocks on a site.
