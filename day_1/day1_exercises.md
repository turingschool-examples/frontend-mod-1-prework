# Capstone Day 1

## Questions and Answers:

1. **On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**

On a website, HTML acts as the skeleton of a page, defining the structures using elements such as head, body, title, paragraph, or header.

2. **What is the difference between an element and a tag?**

An element encapsulates the entirety of a piece of the structure, including the opening tag, closing tag, and any content between those corresponding tags. A tag acts as a defining container, informing you as to what the encapsulated information is acting as. Such as <p></p> to define a paragraph.

3. **Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**

Attributes further refine an element, supplying additional information about the content therein, such as "lang" to specify which language is being used in a paragraph, header, etc.

4. **Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**

The head HTML element contains information about the page, and is not shown on the webpage. Rather, it often contains the title element, which displays the name of the page or information about the page on a tab or at the top of your web browser. Finally, the body element contains everything shown on the actual webpage.

5. **In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**

There are a couple of ways to view the source of a page in chrome. You can either right click a page and select view page source which will open the source in the bottom of the page, or use the hotkey Ctrl + U to open the source in a new tab.

6.  **List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.**

- The '<body></body>' element is the element that contains all elements and text that will be shown on a webpage
- The '<html></html>' element is used to indicate that anything contained within is HTML
- The '<h1></h1>' element is the main header, and acts as the top Header of a page, introducing a webpage
- The '<h2></h2>' element is a sub header, and acts as a header beneath the main header
- The '<title></title>' element is used to display text above the webpage, either in a tab or above the browser

7.  **What are empty elements?**

Empty elements are elements that do not contain words within their tags. They often only have one tag. An example of an empty element is the <hr /> which adds a horizontal line on your page and only requires a single tag.

8.  **What is semantic markup?**

Semantic markup defines the meaning of your webpage's content, rather than its appearance. For instance, <em></em> places emphasis on a piece of text so that a text reader will place emphasis while reading or perhaps you would use <blockquote></blockquote> to add a reference link to a quote, which might show up in a web crawler or google search when searching for pages that reference that link.

9.  **What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.**

- <header> and <footer> which contain the information at the top and bottom of a webpage respectively
- <nav> contains navigational links so a user can move around your website
- <article> acts as a standalone section of the page, such as a blogpost or comment in a comment section
