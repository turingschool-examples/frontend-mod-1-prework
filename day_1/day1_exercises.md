1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

    HTML code provides bones to a website. It "describes the structure" of pages. It formats the head, title, paragraphs and conetent of those paragraphs among other things.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

    Elements are made up of opening and closing tags. The element is the command given such as "paragraph" and the tag says where the element begins and ends: <p> insert text </p>

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

    Attributes provide further information about an element. Each attribute has a name which indicates what kind of information it will provide and a value which indicates the "setting" of the attribute.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

    head: The <head> element generally contains the <title> element. It doesn't show content in the main browser, but contains "information about the page"

    title: The <title> element will usually show up at the top of the browser or the tab or the website.

    body: The <body> is the main contents of the page that show up in the main part of the browser.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

     right click and then click 'view source' option

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

    6.1 <br></br> is a sinlge line break
    6.2 <div></div> a section of a larger document
    6.3 <footer></footer> defines all footer information such as authorship and copyright
    6.4 <center></center> everything in this element will be center aligned
    6.5 <h1></h1> h1 through h6 define different section headings. h1 is the highest and h6 the lowest.

7.  What are empty elements?

     They usually only have one tag and no content within the tag. Like <hr /> which provides a horizontal line.

8.  What is semantic markup?

     They are markups that don't give the page structure, but they provide additional information such as where emphasis is placed on the text or the <article> element which designates "independent self-contained content" (w3schools)

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

      <article></article>
      <aside></aside>
      <header></header>
