  - The purpose of the head, title, and body of HTML is to give hierarchal context to the content being displayed.

`<body>`
- is the meat of the webpage being displayed inside of the browser window.

`<head>`
- comes before the body; This contains info about the page (rather than the info that is being displayed
on the webpage).

`<title>`
- elements will usually be found within the <head>
- elements are displayed in the Title Bar above the URL.

element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  1. `<h1, h2, h3, â€¦h6>` headings
      - HTML has 6 "levels" of headings.Headings introduce the paragraph content
  that will immediately follow

  2. `<p>` paragraph
      - consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse.
      -Text is easier to understand when it is broken up into units aka. paragraphs.

  3. `<sup>`
      - superscript is seen as the number 2 in E=MC<sup>2</sup> (where mc is raised to the power of 2)

  4. `<hr />` horizontal rule

  5. `<i>` italic
      - this will italicize any text within its tags.


7.  What are empty elements?

- `<hr />` and `<img>` are empty elements
  - an element that does not have any words between an opening and
closing tag.

closing tag.

to the page.

  - `<header>`
    - `<nav>`
