###1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML describes the structure of pages.  In an HTML document, everything contained within the <HTML> tags is some sort of information or data that makes up the actual webpage.

###2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
A tag defines the start and end of an element.  An element is composed of opening and closing tags, as well as any content contained between the tags.

###3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes provide additional information about the element content.  The syntax for an attribute is as follows: name="value" where the name describes the information about the element and the value is the information about the attribute.

###4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The <head> element contains metadata about the document.  This can include the title.  Everything contained in the <title> element is what will be displayed on the browser's title bar or tab.  The <body> element is the content of the HTML document.

###5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
In Chrome, all you need to do is right-click the page you are on and select View Page Source.

###6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
<h1></h1> is used for creating large headers.  h1-h6 will determine header size.
<header></header> is used for introductory content.  This will likely contain an <h1> through <h6> heading.  This could be a page name or way to navigate a page.
<br> is used to inset line breaks.
<li></li> is used to define items in a list.  It must be nested in a parent element, typically <ol>Ordered List</ol> or <ul>Unordered List</ul>.
<img> is used to insert an image to the document. The image location will follow the src= attribute, which is required in an <img> element.

###7. What are empty elements?
Elements that cannot contain other elements.  These have no closing tag.  <br> <img> and <link> are examples.

###8. What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup adds information to a page but does not alter the structure of the page itself.  This could include <strong> and <em> tags as well as <blockquote> and <q> tags.

###9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
<header>, <footer>, <article>, and <aside> are all new to HTML5.  All of these elements replace the need for a <div id=> tag.
