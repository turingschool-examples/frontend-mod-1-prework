    <h1>Why I decided to learn how to code</h1>
    <h3>An opportunity to pursue my passions throught the filed of technology</h3>
    <p>There are many reasons why I decided to lear n to code, not least of which is: <em>I just needed a career change.</em> I had accomplished everything that I set out to do in my previous career, and after working for nearly a decade in the brewing industry, I was astonished at how little money I was making, and how little room for growth potential there actually was.</p>
    <p>After seeing many firends complete both front end and back end programs at Turing, and seeing their professional success and contentment in a new career. I knew that Turing was the place that I wanted to be, because I wanted what they had; a satisfying and demanding career with diverse paths and opportunities.</p>

    <p>I see unlimited potential in the field of development to pusue any and all interests that I have, and make them better and more accessible with technology. Quite a few of the analog activitite that I am engaged in can be considered anachronistic and are now just coming into their own in the digital age. Take <b>hunting or fishing</b> for example; These activities have been enaged in by human beings for thousands of years, but only recently are we using tech in these pursuits to be more successful, or safer or better prepared to enjoy these timeless activites. I want to become a developer so that I can continue to further develop tech in these areas and help get more people enjoying the great outdoors.</p>
