// In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
// to achieve the desired result. Run this code using node in terminal.

// example: Write code below to assign your name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// Write code below to assign the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var houseElf = "Dobby";
console.log(houseElf);

// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console:
var warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!";
console.log(warning);

// example: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var students = 22;
students = 22 + 2;
console.log(students);

//result is 24

could also work as:

var students = 22;
var moreStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(moreStudents);

// Write the code below to subtract 2 students from the `students` variable and
// log the result:
var students = 22;
students = 22 - 2;
console.log(students);
