1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
    HTML code has characters within it that inform the browser about
    what is on that HTML page, specifically between <HTML> </HTML> tags.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
    A tag is < > and the element is in between those tags, as shown above
    the HTML is in between two tags < >.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
    An attribute to tell us additional information about the tag, for example, <a href ="website listed here"> this attribute tells us that the a tag tag is going to be a website, = to "listed website"
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
    In HTML when you designate tags of body, head and title, you are showing how the input is going to be displayed on the webpage.  Much like our bodies, everything is contained within it.  We list the <body> first, then the <head> usually this first thing we read/notice, and within that head tag is the <title> telling us first thing on the webpage what it is that this page is all about.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
    f12
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
    <h1> is would be a the largest heading on a webpage, used in the <body> element.
    <b> is the bolding of text </bold>
    <em> is the emphasis of a word </em>
    <abbr> is a cool tag that will allow the full spelling of an abbreviated word or acronym </abbr>
    <li> is a way to add a list on a webpage </li>
7.  What are empty elements?
    An empty element only uses on tag, most often an extra white space or a break.  For example, if you wanted an extra space in between the end of your paragraph and the contact information at the bottom of a page.
8.  What is semantic markup?
    Semantic markup is a cool feature that allows you to add more information to the webpage without actually changes made to the look of the page. Used for search programs or screen readers.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
    I used two as an example in question #6 - <em></em> and <abbr> </abbr> where added with HTML5, along with <blockquote></blockquote> (changes the look to be more "codey")  In addition to the looks, it allows you to tell more about your webpage behind the scenes.
