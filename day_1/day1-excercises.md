Open the day1-exercises.md file you created earlier, and answer these questions about the reading in that file:

1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML code provides the basis for what the website page should be structured and how it conveys its information, everything from headlines, boxes, font, and so in is dictated by the HTML code
2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
Both items are often conflated, though generally, a tag refers to an opening and closing parts of code, so <p> and </p> would both be considered tags. However, an element includes not only the opening tags, but also the content in between them. So <p>content</p> would in of itself, be considered an element.
3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
attributes help change characteristics of an element including font, size, color, and more. they can be used both aesthetically for a page, but also to convey information on that page better.  
4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The Head element is supposed to supply data that isn't normally displayed on the page itself, it provides important information for search engines for people to better find the website. Additionally, information in the head section are not generally visible from an outside perspective as this tends to be more behind the scenes. The title is supposed to provide information on the content of the page itself. Generally, we want this information to be concise and specific to the topic at hand. The body is what the user ultimately sees as a result of the HTML code. This includes the font, color, size, etc. Everything under the body element is what will eventually become what we see on the site.
5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
Chrome accesses the local Domain Name System (DNS) Server that retrieves whatever website you put in as a series of numbers that we call an IP address. In this way, the DNS server is often referred to as the a sort of phone book. Once the DNS server brings back the IP address, your device may then be able to access the site directly with the new information. Sometimes, the IP address is stored on your computer so that the browser does not need to contact the local DNS again.
6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  i. <h1>content</h> - heading; like a newspaper, this element creates headings for HTML. They can be as big or as small of headlines as you need depending on the number.
  ii. <i>content</i> - italicize; this element will italicize whatever is in the tags.
  iii. <q>content</q> - quote; these tags will put into quotation marks anything that is in between them
  iv. <br> - line break; sometimes, using consecutive <p></p> tags will show up as one giant paragraph on the page itself. <br> is a self contained element that can be used to create a line break between each section
  v. <sub>content</sub> subscript; subscript elements can be used so as to make things such as footnotes on your page.
7. what is semantic markup?
Semantic Markups may look similar to other styles- for example, <i>italicize</i> vs <em>emphasize</em> but their uses are specifically helpful for speech programs that are often used for disabled people. In other words, they provide context to the content that is more than just a stylistic choice as it has functional purposes that can be taken advantage of.
8. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
