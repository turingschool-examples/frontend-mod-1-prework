1. **On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**
  * HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) defines the structure of a webpage.
2. **What is the difference between an element and a tag?**
  * An element tells the browser information about what is between two tags(opening and closing).
3. **Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**
  * Attributes help us further define elements. These add extra information about the content of the element.
4. **Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**
  * The Head tag contains information that isn't depicted directly on the page, but instead above it. This contains the Title element which adds a page title to the broser, but not directly in the page Body. The body element includes everything that will be displayed in the main browser window.
5. **In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**
