1. On a website, the purpose of HTML code is to describe the structure of pages. To describe the structure of these pages, code is added to the words that are going to appear on the page.
2. Tags in HTML are labels used to mark the start and finish of an HTML element. A HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
3. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equal sign. An example would be an attribute called "lang" and is used to indicate the language used in the element, and the value could specify US English.
4. The body in HTML indicates that everything inside the element is shown in the browser window. The head contains information about the page (rather than the information that is shown within the main part of the browser). The title in HTML is either shown in the top of the browser, above where the URL usually goes, or on the tab for that page. Anything written here will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browswer window.
5. To view the source of a website (from Chrome) you click on "view" at the top of the page and then scroll over "Developer" and then click "view source." This will show you all of the source code that was used to create that specific page.
6. Five different HTML elements are:
  6.1 Headings: These allow for different parts of a webpage to be separated into parts with varying degrees of importance and size. They are presented as, <h1></h1>, <h2></h2>
  6.2 Bold & Italic: These allow for two different types of emphasis (bolded words and italic words). They are presented as, <b></b>, <i></i>
  6.3 Superscript & Subscript: These elements are used to contain characters that should be superscript and subscript (raising a number to a power, or denoting footnotes or chemical notations). They are presented as, <sup></sup>, <sub></sub>
  6.4 Line Breaks: This element will allow for a break in the line in a set of text. It is presented as <br />
  6.5 Horizontal Rules: This can be used to create a break between themes with a line. This is presented as <hr />
7. Empty elements are elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag - it usually only has one tag.
8. Semantic markup is not necessarily intended to affect the structure of a given webpage, but it does add extra information to the page.
9. Three new elements in HTML5 are sectioning elements, figures, and asides.
