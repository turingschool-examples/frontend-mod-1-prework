Reading Response Ch. 1 & 2 from HTML and CSS
1. The purpose of HTML code is to describe the structure of a web page

2. The difference between an element and a tag is that an element comprises the opening tag,
the closing tag and any content that lies between
The tag itself is just the opening and closing brackets and characters
i.e. <p> </p> paragraph tags show an empty paragraph element

3. Attributes tell us additional information about the contents of an element
They are in the opening tag and made of up a name and value
i.e. <p lang="en-us>" specifies that the language used in this element us US English

4. The <body> element is everything that is shown inside the main browser </body>
The <head> element contains information about the page in the form of a title </head>
The <title> also gives information about the page but is show at the top of the browser or tab </title>

5. Go to View -> Developers -> View source

6. <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> are headings from largest to smallest </h>
<p> This creates a paragraph </p>
<b> BOLD WORDS </b>
<i> italic words </i>
<sup> superscript text like two to the power of two </sup>
<sub> subscript like footnotes <sub>

7. Empty elements are tags with no content <> </>

8. Semantic markup uses elements that don't affect the structure of the webpage but add extra information
i.e. <strong> means important and is bold</strong>
<em> indicates emphasis and is italicised </em>
<blockquote> is for longer quotes that make an entire paragraph </blockquote>
<q> is for short quotes </q> some but not all (ahem, IE) browsers put quotes aroung the <q> element so many avoid this
Both <blockquote> and <q> can use the site attribute to source the quote to a url

9. <header> <nav> <article> <aside> <footer> are five new elements to HTML 5 that can be used in place of a <div> element
