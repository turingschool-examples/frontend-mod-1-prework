## 1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  
  HTML code allows you to define the structure of the web page, using a main heading and sub-headings.

## 2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  
  Elements are the characters that live inside of angled brackets. The tags tell you something about the information that is 
  inside of the opening and closing tags.

## 3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

We use attributes to provide extra information about the contents of an element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value.

## 4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  
  The head: This part contains information about the page and it displayed in the title bar of the tabs.
  
  The title: This contains the elements that are displayed in the URL or in the tab, it's the words you see that describes the page you are on.
  
  The body: Everything that is inside of the body element is displayed in the web page that you see.

## 5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  Once you have opened the page you want to view, you click the "view" menu in your browser, the click the option that says "source" or "view source". You will then see a window that will contain all the source code that was used to create the web page.

## 6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
 
  `h1` Is a heading element and is used to represent the first main heading.
  
  `h2` Is a sub heading and is used to help structure the page, it shows it in larger text than the body text.
  
  `body` Everything inside of this element is shown inside the main browser window.
  
  `b` Makes the characters inside of this tag bold
  
  `i` This makes the characters inside of this tag italic

## 7. What are empty elements?
  
  It is an element that cannot have any child nodes. using a closing tag on empty elements in HTML is usually invalid. For example some empty elements in HTML are: <area> <br> <embed> and <hr>

## 8. What is semantic markup?
  
  It provides extra emphasis where you need it in your text, such as making words bold or in italics

## 9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
  
  `strong` Shows that the contents have a strong importance, it makes them appear in bold text
  
  `em` Makes a subtle change on the emphasized text, this makes the words inside the tags italic
  
  `q` Puts the text inside this tag into quotes, meant for short quotes
