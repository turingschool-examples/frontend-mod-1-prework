<h2>1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code? </h2>
<p>HTML describes the structure of pages using elements. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.</p>
<h2>2. What is the difference between an element and a tag? </h2>
<p>An element is made up of tags, usually two but sometimes just one. Elements tell the browser something about the information that sits between the tags. Tags are like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between the tags.</p>
<h2>3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?</h2>
<p>Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They can be used to indicate what language is being used.</p>
<h2>4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.</h2>
<p>The head element contains information about the page like the title of the page, which is shown at the top of the browser window.. It is not shown in the browser window. The title element contains is a brief description of the page and is shown at the top of the browser or the tab for that page. It is part of the head element. The body element contains all the information that is shown inside the main browser window. The body contains the actual content of the web page.</p>
<h2>5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?</h2>
<p>Right click anywhere on the page and go down to view source code is one way. Ctrl + U is another way. You can also click the Menu (three dots), select More Tools, then Developer Tools. I think maybe F12 if you have function keys also works?</p>
<h2>6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.<h2>
<p><h1></h1> Is used for a main heading.
<b></b> Is used to make characters bold.
<br /> Is used for a line break.
<strong></strong> Is used to show importance and usually appears in bold.
<q></q> Is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.</p>
<h2>7. What are empty elements?</h2>
<p>Empty elements do not have an opening and a closing tag. They usually have just one tag that contains a “ /” before the closing angled bracket. <br /> and <hr /> are examples.</p>
<h2> 8. What is semantic markup?</h2>
<p>Semantic markup are text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of a web page, but to add extra information to the pages. <em></em> and <strong></strong> are examples. Their purpose is to describe the content of the web page more accurately and are often used in screen readers and search engines. A screen reader voice can add emphasis to <em></em>.</p>
<h2>9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.</h2>
<p>Header, nav and article are new elements for HTML5 that have to do with the layout of the page. They replace previously used div elements. They are used to describe the structure of the page and to make the code easier to follow. They are also useful for screen readers and search engines.</p>
