-On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  HTML code helps describe both the structure and visual presentation of information on a website.
-What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  An element is anything that is enclosed within 2 brackets, but a tag is used to indicate the open and close of that element. for instance, h1 is a header element, but the h1 and /h1 are tags that indicate what in included in the header.
-Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  The attributes tell us a little bit more about the elements. They can help detail what to expect within the element. EX) within a paragraph element p, we can use attributes to show what language will be used in the paragraph by using the lang attribute - p lang="en-us".
Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  These are all structural elements that indicate how a site will be set up. The head element indicates a header on the browser and usually contains title element, which is shown at the top of the browser. The body element separates out what will be a part of the body of content in the webpage itself.
