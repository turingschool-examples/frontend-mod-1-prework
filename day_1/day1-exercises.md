## Chapters 1 and 2 on Structure and Text

### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML files are text documents that describe the structure of the web page. By using elements we can break the page into sections like header, body, and paragraphs.

### What is the difference between an element and a tag?

An element tells the browser something about information between an opening and closing tag. Tags live inside angled brackets and the closing at has an extra `/` in it, like `</span>` .

### Why do we use attributes in HTML

Attributes are used in HTML to provide more information about an element. They are used in opening tags and require a name and a value.

### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

The head is used to contain information about the page, as opposed to information shown in the browser. The title is shown in the tab for your page, or in the area at the top of the browser. The body element contains everything displayed in the browser.

### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

Under “View” you can select on “Developer” followed by “View Source.” Option+Command+U is the keyboard shortcut.

### List five different HTML elements and what they are used for.

1. `<H1></H1>` is the largest of six heading sizes and is used for main headings.
2. `<b></b>` will make the text between the tags bold.
3. `<i></i>` will make the text between the tags appear in italics.
4. `<p></p>` will make the text between the tags a new paragraph.
5. `<br />` is an empty element that forces a line break.

### What are empty elements?

Empty elements appear with no element between opening and closing tags. They are written with only one tag. `<hr />` for horizontal rule is an example.

### What is semantic markup?

Semantic markup are text elements that provide more information to your pages, but don't change the visual structure of your web pages. `<em></em>` for emphasis that a screen reader can detect is an example. These should not be used to change the appearance of the page content.

### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5?

1. `<article>` is a container for a section of a page that could potentially be syndicated or stand alone. It's an independent piece of content.
2. `<aside>` when used in an article contains information that is relevant to the content but not essential. When used outside of an article it contains information pertaining to the entire page, such as links to other sections of the site.
3. `<section>` can be used to break the page up into smaller pieces. An example would be an article that is very long. <section> would allow you to split the article into smaller navigable chunks.
