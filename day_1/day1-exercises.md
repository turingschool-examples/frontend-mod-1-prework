1. HTML describes the structure of pages. It separates pages into headings, body, paragraphs, etc. It uses elements to format a page so that the computer knows how to process and display the information we're giving it.
2. While people often use the two terms interchangeably, an element is both the opening and closing tag with anything in between. For example, in <h1>Hello</h1>, the entire phrase is an element while only <h1> and </h1> are tags. Tags are parts of elements.
3. Attributes allow us to be more specific with our elements. They include a name and a value separated by an equals sign. For example, in <img id="main_photo"></img>, id is the attribute name (denoting the type of info being provided) and main_photo is the attribute value (denoting the information or setting of the attribute).
4. The head has information about the webpage. This is often where you find the title of the webpage. It does not show up in the body of your webpage. The title is the name of your page, and it shows up on the title bar or tab of that website. The body contains everything that will be displayed inside the browser window.
5. Right click and select "View Page Source."
6. <b></b> is a bold element which allows text to be displayed in bold. <h1></h1> is a heading element used for the main heading. <br /> is a line break element that allows you add a line break in the middle of a paragraph or element. <q></q> is used for shorter quotes within a paragraph. <dfn></dfn> is used to provide a definition for a new term being used in a document.
7. Empty elements don't have words between their opening and closing tags, and they are often just one tag (such as <br /> or <hr />).
8. Semantic markup is the text elements that don't change the structure of a webpage but that provide other useful information. For example, <em> shows when something should be emphasized. It shouldn't be used to change the appearance of the text (use CSS for that instead), but it tells screen readers, search engines, and other programs that process HTML information how to read that text.
9. In HTML5, we don't have to use divs as much. <header> includes the information that would be at the heading of our webpage. The navigation for a website is within the <nav> tag. This is where we contain the information and links to jump to other pages and sections within our website. <article> is used to contain the main contents of a page. These more specific semantic elements make our code easier to organize and easier for programs to digest.
