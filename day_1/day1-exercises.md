<p><b>-On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?</p></b>
  <p>HTML code helps describe both the structure and visual presentation of information on a website.</p>

<p><b>-What is the difference between an element and a tag?</p></b>
  <p>An element is anything that is enclosed within 2 brackets, but a tag is used to indicate the open and close of that element. for instance, h1 is a header element, but the h1 and /h1 are tags that indicate what in included in the header.</p>

<p><b>-Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?</p></b>
  <p>The attributes tell us a little bit more about the elements. They can help detail what to expect within the element. EX) within a paragraph element p, we can use attributes to show what language will be used in the paragraph by using the lang attribute - p lang="en-us".</p>

<p><b>-Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.</p></b>
  <p>These are all structural elements that indicate how a site will be set up. The head element indicates a header on the browser and usually contains title element, which is shown at the top of the browser. The body element separates out what will be a part of the body of content in the webpage itself.</p>

<p><b>-In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?</p></b>
  <p>In chrome on my macbook, i can either type option + command + U, or I can can go to View - Developer - View Source</p>

<p><b>-List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, p and /p is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.</p></b>
<p>  -ul is an unordered list element, and it represents the start of a list that contains items in no order.</p>
  <p>-cite  is a citation element, and indicates where a citation is from and puts the contents into italics.</p>
  <p>-h1 is a header element, and it indicates the main header in a page. This is used for the largest title/header on the page, and goes up to h6 for other headers (decreases in size as number increases)</p>
  <p>-img is the image element, and is used to add an image to the site. this is an empty element, meaning it requires no closing tags</p>
  <p>-q is a quote element, and puts quotation marks around the content.</p>
<p><b>-What are empty elements? </p></b>
  <p>Empty elements are those which do not require a closing tag to be used. includes tags like img and meta</p>
<p><b>What is semantic markup? </p></b>
  <p>Semantic markup has to do with providing extra information past just how the page is to be set up. This provides info like what words need emphasis, quotations, meanings of acronyms, etc.</p>
<p><b>What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.</p></b>
  </p>Three new semantic elements are footer, details, and summary. footer specifies a footer for a document or section of a webpage and contains information about it, such as the author, contact info, etc. details includes additional details for the user to view, while summary details a heading for the details element.
