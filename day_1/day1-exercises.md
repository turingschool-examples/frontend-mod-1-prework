1. HTML is a markup language standard that provides a way to design and display items in a web browser. HTML is the building blocks and structure of a webpage.
1. Elements are the larger structure pieces of HTML, Such as <html>, <head>, <body>. Tags are smaller pieces generally contained in a larger element, this being like <p>, <h>, <title>.
1. HTML elements give semantic meaning to the content inside of them. Many of them also have automatic formatting that generally works well with the kind of content one would expect it to contain, such as extra vertical spacing between <p> tags, or sizing and bolding <h> tags.
1. The head tag contains information about the page, such as the title (which is a description at the top of a browser window or tab) or reference to a file for CSS, Javascript, or language formatting. The body contains all of the actual information to be displayed on the website.
1. You can either right-click and select "View Page Source", or use the F12 key to open the Developer page.
1. List of HTML elements:
- <h1-6> Structurally and semantically provide a heading for content
- <strong> both bolds and semantically shows text of importance
- <sub/sup> scripts modify the text to show it should be subscript or superscript
- <br /> provides a line break in text
- <blockquote> places the text in an indented paragraph structure. It also semantically identifies it as quoted text.
1. Empty elements do not have text between an open and close tag. An example of this is <br /> or <hr />. They modify the content of the text, but do not actually have any text contained inside of them.
1. Semantic markup is a way to provide added context or information regarding the contained text, but do not necessarily modify the structure of the HTML markup. An example would be the <em> tag, for emphasizing by italicizing and showing importance to screen readers. Quotes (<q>, <blockquote>), citations <cite>, and abbreviations <abbr> are other examples of Semantic markup elements.
1. <header>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>
