## Day 1 Exercises

1.  HTML describes the structure of a page. It tells the browser what the order of things/information the webpage is trying to display.

2.  The difference between an element and a tag is that an element is made up of 2 tags. An opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag is the start of the element and the closing tag is the end of that element. Each element tells the browser something about the information inbetween the tags(or containers).
3.  Attributes provide additional information about the element. These are denoted by a name and a value seperated by an = sign. The value of the attribute should be placed in double-quotes.
4.  The purpose of the `<head> </head>` element is to give the browser information about the page. The `<title> </title>` tag is the title of the page, this will show up in the tab portion of the browser. The `<body> </body>` element is everything that is visible to the user. This is where all the important things take place. Such as: links, images, buttons, animations, etc.
5.  To view the source of a webpage, you can ether right-click and click "View Page Source" or the handy keyboard shortcut Option+Command+U.

        4.  span: denoted by the `<span></span>` tags, is a generic wrapper. By it's self, it does not represent anything. The content inside of the tags is whats important.

        5.  line breaks: denoted by the '<br />' tags, is a line break, this will render everything in the tag on a new paragraph.
7.  Empty elements are things that do not have any words between the tag. `<hr />` would put a horizontal line on the page. Since it is just a line, it does not need any information in the tag.
8.  Semantic markup adds extra information to the webpage. They do not affect the structure of the layout. This is especially usefull for displaying text on a page. You can use it make things bold, italics, emphasis, blockquotes.
