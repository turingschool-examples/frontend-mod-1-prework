1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML gives structure to the content of a webpage whether it is a body of text or embedding videos into a webpage HTML makes it so that it is visually appealing and intuitive to the user rather than simply listing out data on a blank canvas page.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
a tag is something like <p></p> signifying the start and end point of a paragraph element. The element is the content that lies between the tags that will ultimately fill your site or program.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes allow for the modification of elements without having to program every individual instance. For example if you wanted there to be a paragraph or sentence that can be viewed in multiple countries a 'lang' attribute can be applied so that it can automatically switch the languages according to the user without having to retype each individual language into the website.
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The <head> element allows the user to organize their data into a head and a body. The body will contain the text or whatever media is being portrayed but by seperating the head and the body as different elements the designer can use a different style of formatting on the head and the body so that the website looks more organized and visually appealing to the end user.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
Open a webpage and click on the view option then click on view source to pull up the source code for that website.
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
<body></body> is a body element that contains the main body of content on a website.
<head></head> is the header element that usually contains the title within it and also houses any information that should be displayed towards the top of a webpage.
<title></title> element contains the title of the webpage usually displayed toward the top of a webpage or before a body.
<b></b> is for bold Text
<i></i> puts text into italics
7.  What are empty elements?
Empty elements are elements that do not have any content between their opening and closing tags. An example of this would be the <br /> that creates a line break that itself does not hold any content.
8.  What is semantic markup?
A semantic markup is data that is being described in the code but is not necessarily displayed visually for example the element <blockquote> indicates that a quote is being used and formats the quote accordingly even though there are many ways to make this change visually it is describing to the website or developers that this block of text is treated as a quote.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
