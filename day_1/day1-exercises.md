## Chapter 1 and 2 Questions and Answers
1) On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
* Answer: The purpose of HTML code is that it is a markup language that allows the creation of a webpage to be viewed in a web browser.  With HTML code, users can post text, images, links, video, and sound on a webpage.

2) What is the difference between an element and a tag
* Answer:  Elements in HTML are the characters that live inside the angled brackets of HTML code.  The tags of the element are simply the openings and closings of the HTML Element.  For example: ``<h1>This is a Heading</h1>``.  This entire phrase is a heading element, with an opening tag of ``<h1>`` and a closing tag of ``</h1>``.  The characters between will be viewable on the webpage, while the tags will not.

3) Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
* Answer: We use attributes in HTML elements to give more information about the element.  For example, we can tell the webpage to use a specific language (like Spanish) with an attribute.

4) Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
* Answer: The ``<head>`` element, found at the top of the page, gives information about the page, not the actual information shown in the web browser.  A ``<title>`` element is generally found inside of a ``<head>`` element and the contents of the ``<title>`` are shown at the top or tab of the webpage.  The title also will not appear in the main browser, but everything inside of the ``<body>`` element will.  The ``<body>`` element is the element where all information within it is shown inside of the web browser.

5) In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
* Answer:  On the Chrome menu bar at the top, click on 'View', then scroll down to 'Developer', and then click on 'View Source.' The keyboard shortcut is option + command + U.

6) List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, ``<p></p>`` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
* Answer:
  * ``<h1></h1>`` is the a header element, used for the headings on a page.  Headings from from ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>``, each heading getting smaller as the number gets bigger. ``<h2>`` through ``<h6>`` are used for subheadings of a webpage.
  * ``<b></b>`` is the Bold text element.  You wrap text inside of these tags when you want the text to be bold.
  * ``<i></i>`` is the italics element. You wrap text inside of these tags when you want the text to be in italics.
  * ``<br />`` is the line break element. There is no closing tag for this one, the user simply places the ``<br />`` after the characters to indicate a line break at the point.
  * ``<hr />`` is the horizontal rule element that will place a line between sections of the text on the webpage.  Just like ``<br />``, there is no closing tag for  ``<hr />``, you simply place it where you want the horizontal line break to be.

7) What are empty elements?
* Answer:  Empty elements are elements that do not require closing tags.  In question 6, the last two elements, ``<br />`` and ``<hr />`` are examples of empty elements. ``<img>`` for image is another example of an empty element.

8) What is semantic markup?
* Answer: Semantic markup are text elements meant to add extra information to the webpage but not affect the structure. For example, the ``<em></em>`` element will emphasize the text in between it's tags.  A screen reader would then change the tone for that specific text.

9) What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
* Answer:
  * ``<nav></nav>`` Used for the main navigational block of a webpage.
  * ``<article></article>`` Used for sectioning off a part of the webpage that could standalone
  * ``<aside></aside>`` Used for placing a section of the text to either side of the main article.
