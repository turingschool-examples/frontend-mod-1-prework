# Day 1 Exercises

## 1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML describes the structure of pages. It allows you to markup the text with code to structure the pages. HTML also allows you to create links to move from one page to another seamlessly.

## 2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
Elements are the characters that live inside angled brackets, whereas the tags are the bracketsâ€”similar to a fence for the element. Elements usually have an opening and closing tag. Elements tell the browser about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

## 3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
To provide additional information about the contents of an element.

## 4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The head element provides information about the page that you don't want shown in the main browser window. The head usually contains a title, which will appear in the title bar at the top of the browser window or on your tab bar if you have multiple tabs open. The body is everything shown inside the main browser window and is the "meat" of the page.


## 5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
Go to the View menu in your browser and then hover over the Developer option, which will give you the View Source option. A new window will open with the source code.

## 6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
+ `<b> </b>` is a bold element
+ `<i> </i>` is an italic element
+ `<sup> </sup>` is a superscript element. For example raising something to the second power.
+ `<br />` is the line break element
+ `<hr />` is the horizontal rule element

## 7. What are empty elements?
Elements that don't have any words between the opening and closing tags, such as the `<br />` element.

## 8. What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup isn't intended to affect the structure of your web page, but they add extra information to the page. It's less about the aesthetic output and more about giving additional information for a search engine, for example.

## 9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
The following help describe the structure of the page and make the code easier to follow and read.
+ `<header>`
+ `<article>`
+ `<nav>`
