## Day 1

### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML is going to tell a website how something is displayed and structured.

### What is the difference between an element and a tag?
Although they are often used interchangeably, an element includes the opening and closing tags and the content in them.

## Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
An attribute is going to give additional, important info about the content of an element.

### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  * The head element is going to provide info about the page. the info doesn't show up with the browser window. The head element often includes the title element in it.
  * The title element of a page is going to show up in the title area at the very top on the browser (usually above the url of the page).
  * The body element is anything that is displayed within the main browser window.

### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
In Chrome you go to the top and select View, Developer, View Source or you can type cmmd + optn - U

### List five different HTML elements and what they are used for.
  * `<b>` is used to make words bold. The tag is placed around the word(s) that need to be emphasized  
  * The `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags are going to make certain characters behave different so the `<sup>` element would make the "th" in 4<sup>th</sup> go up and smaller and the `<sub>` element would make the 2 in CO<sub>2</sub> small and go down.
  * `<br />` is the line break tag and can be placed in the middle of a paragraph element to bring the text down to a different line for a new paragraph that is all located in the same paragraph element.
  * `<hr />` This creates a break in between different ideas on the page. And can add a horizontal line between those ideas to show they are separated.
  * `<h1>` Elements can be numbered 1-6 and they get smaller as you go down with the h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest. They are used for titles or sections that have a new idea.

### What are empty elements?
They are elements that do not have any text between the opening and closing tags. The `<hr />` tag would be an example. It usually only has one tag.

### What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup provides info about what part of a sentence might have an emphasis. Ex: `<blockquote>` and `<q>`
  * It also can describe how an element would behave on the page.

### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements:
  * HTML5 uses the `<abbr>` element for both abbreviations and acronyms, before there was a separate `<acronym>` element.
  * HTML5 also uses elements that divide up the different parts of a webpage. The names of the elements are self explanatory for where you'd find the content of what's in it. Ex: `<nav> <header> <aside> <footer> <content>`
  * Before this HTML would use id attributes to do this ex: `<div id-"header">`
