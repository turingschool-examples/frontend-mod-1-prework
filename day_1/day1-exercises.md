## On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML is used to describe the structure of a website. HTML uses elements and tags to define the basics of how the webpage will be viewed and structured.
## What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element tells the browser something about the information that sits between the opening and closing tags. A tag informs the browser of the beginning or end of the element contained within.
## Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element. By providing a name (which indicates what kind of extra information we are adding), and a value (which provides the actual information for the attribute), we can create more detailed structures for our website.
## Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The `<head>` element is used to provide information about the page, but does not appear in the main body of the page on a browser
The `<title>` element is used to indicate the title of the webpage you are visiting. In Chrome, or other browsers that allow multiple tabs, this is what appears on each individual tab.
The `<body>` element indicates the beginning and end of everything that will appear in the browser window.
## In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
You can navigate to the site, right-click anywhere on the page and select "View Page Source" from the menu.
## List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p> </p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
* `<h1> <h2> <h3>` etc. are used to represent main and subheadings.
* `<b>` is used to make characters or words bold.
* `<i>` can be used to make characters appear italic.
* `<sup>` is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.
* `<br />` will add a line break in the middle of a paragraph.
## What are empty elements?
Empty elements are HTML elements that have no content, and do not contain an end tag (such as the `<br />` element).
## What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup is a way to provide more information about the website without affecting the structure of the page. This allows you to describe the content of your web page more accurately.
## What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML
The `<section>` element groups related content together, with each section having it's own heading.
The `<hgroup>` element is used to group together a set of one or more heading elements so they can be treated as one single heading.
the `<article>` element can be used for any content that can stand alone.
