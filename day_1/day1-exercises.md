1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

    HTML code provides the structure for the contents of webpages. The elements defined by HTML tags have assigned places to display on a webpage. Having content inside assigned HTML elements will make mass changes or updates easier by calling that element.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

    An HTML element is comprised of the tags and the content between those tags. Whereas a tag is more defining the contents purpose. Is this a title or a paragraph? Tags help with informational hierarchy and remind me of old printing press layouts.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

    Attributes provide additional information about the contents of certain html elements. The text uses the example of defining a language attribute.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

    The head element contains information about the page that isn't displayed in the same way as the following elements are. It's like a debrief for the browser before getting into the nitty gritty of your content. The title element is often part of the head element, and can normally be found as the title of your tab above the URL. The body element is what is shown in the main browser window. This is generally where all the main content goes as well as videos and images.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

    In Chrome I went to the view tab, scrolled down to developer and selected view source in the slide out menu. I can also use the shortcut option + command + I to open developer tools and look at the sources tab.

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

    An HTML heading element has six "degrees" of heading <h1> to <h6>. <h1> is used for main headings like a newspaper headline and each subheading is nested under the previous. Under an <h1> there is likely and <h2>, <h3> and so on.

    We can make characters appear in bold case by wrapping the content in the bold tags <b> </b>. This can allow parts of a sentence to standout as visually different.

    In a similar fashion the italic element can be achieved by wrapping text in the italic tags <i> </i>. This would represent a section of text said in a different way from the surrounding content such as technical terms, ship names, and foreign languages.

    The superscript element is used to contain characters like dates or mathematical concepts like the 7<sup>th</sup> and raising a number to a power.

    To create necessary line breaks within paragraphs you can use the break element. <br   /> will start whatever comes after the break tag on the next line.

7.  What are empty elements?

    These are elements that have only one tag. These include <br /> and <hr /> the horizontal rule tag.

8.  What is semantic markup?

    Semantic markup are text elements that do not affect the structure of the page but do provide extra information to them. Semantic markup elements help add appropriate emphasis, identify quotations, and provide richer information for screen readers and browsers alike.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

    The <nav> element contains the major navigational blocks on a website.
    The <article> element is a container for any section for a page that could be a stand alone, article, or blog post. These can be nested.
    The <aside> element when in inside an <article> element would contain information related to the article like a glossary. When not inside an <article> an <aside> acts as a container for information relevant to the rest of the site, links to other sections, related posts, or recent comments.
