**1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**

HTML describes the structure of information presented to the user on web pages.

**2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?**

HTML elements are characters that live inside angled brackets ``<>``. Elements are usually made up of two tags, an opening and closing tag. Each element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags. Therefore, two individual tags are needed to create an HTML element.

**3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They allow us to assign a value that is recognizable to the browser.

**4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**

The `<head>` element allows us to convey information about the page to the browser. This tends to be important when it comes to SEO.

The ``<title>`` element are either shown in the tab or above the URL for the webpage. This is also vital for SEO.

Lastly, the `<body>` element contains the information that will be shown within the main browser window.

**5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**

In order to view the source of a website in Chrome you can use the shortcut `shit+command+U` or you can navigate to the menubar, click "View", then hover over "Developer", then click on "View Source."

**6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.**

1. `<br />` Allows you to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph.
1. `<hr />` A horizontal rule can be inserted to create a visual break between sections of a paragraph.
1. `<b>` Allows you to bold particular words.
1. `<i>` This element allows you to put words in italics.
1. `<sup>` This element allows you to superscript chracters and words.

**7. What are empty elements?**

Empty elements have no words between their opening and closing tag. They usually only require one tag. For example, `<br />`.

**8. What is semantic markup?**

Semantic markup is a text element that is not intended to affect the structure of web pages, instead, they add extra information to the pages. You use these elements to inform other programs such as screen readers and search engines how to interact with your page.

**9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.***

1. The `<figcaption>` element provides a description of a `<figure>` elemnt such as a an image or video. I can see this being very useful in the case of a screen reader or visually impaired accessibility programs.
1. The `<article>` element specifies independent, self-contained content. This is especially useful in blog or news style sites.
1. The `<header>` element specifies a header for a document or section. It displays introductory content.
