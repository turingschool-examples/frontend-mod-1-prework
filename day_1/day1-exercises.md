*HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites*

**On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**

On a website, the purpose of HTML code is to describe the structure of pages.

**What is the difference between an element and a tag?**

The difference between an element and a tag is that elements are made up of characters that live inside angled brackets. Elements are usually made up of two tags. The terms are often used interchangeably, however, an element comprises the opening tag and the
closing tag and any content that lies between them.

**Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**

We use attributes in HTML elements because they provide additional information about the contents of an element. They will appear
on the opening tag of an element and are made up of a name and a value that is separated by an equals sign.

**Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**

- The purpose of the head element is to contain information about the page, rather than the information that is shown within the main part of the browser.

- The purpose of the title element is to display the title of the web page in the browser window. You will usually find the title inside the heal element.

- The purpose of the the body element is to show you everything that is inside the main browser of what you are looking at when you enter a website.

**In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**

From the chrome browser, you would click on the view menu. Once you click on that, go down to developer and click on that. Once clicked, push on the view source and it will show you the source of the website.

**List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text**

- `<h1></h1>` is a main heading paragraph element. It is used to represent the main paragraph of the website page. There is also `<h2></h2>`, `<h3></h3>`, `<h4></h4>`, `<h5></h5>` and so on.

- `<b></b>` is a bold element. It is used to show what you are trying to bold in your writing.

- `<i></i>` is an italic element. It is used to show what you are trying to italicize in your writing.

- `<cite></cite>` is a citation element. It is used for when you are trying to reference a piece of work such as a book. It can be used to indicate where the citation is from.

- `<sub></sub>` is the subscript element. It is used to contain characters that should be subscript.

**What are empty elements?**

Empty elements are elements without a closing tag on HTML documents. An example of an empty element is the `<br />` element. With this element you will only need an opening tag.

**What is semantic markup?**

Semantic markup is a form of text elements that have no intention to structure the web page, but they provide extra information to the pages and to have more accuracy.

**What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5?**

- `<article></article>` is a semantic element that acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

- `<header></header>` this element can be used for the main header at the top or bottom of every page on the site. It can also be used for an individual <article> within the page.

- `<figure></figure>` is a semantic element that can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article and not just images. The article should still make sense if the content of the <figure> element were moved.
