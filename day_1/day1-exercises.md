1. The purpose of HTML code on a website is text with tags and elements that describes the structure of a website.
2. An element exists inside of two tabs, one opening and one closing. the element tells the web browser about the information that exists between the opening and closing tabs. Tabs hold elements, elements are information.
3. We use attributes in HTML elements to provide additional information. An attribute is made of both a name and a value. The attribute name tells what type of information is being given. The attribute value specifies the information or setting of the attribute name.
4. A head element exists at the top of the browser window. The title element usually exists in the head element. Title elements also show if there are multiple tabs open on the browser. The body element contains everything that is going to exist inside of the main page of the browser.
5. To view the source of a website select view, then developer, then view source. You could also use Option + Command + U.
6. The <HTML> </HTML> element contains the HTML code.  The <body></body> contains everything in the browser window. A <head></head> element is information about the page, a <title></title> element is usually found in the <head></head> element. Anything inside of a <title></title> element will appear in the title bar or tab of the browser window. <h1> is the main heading and <h2> is a sub heading
7. empty elements are elements that that do not have words between the opening and closing tags. Empty elements usually only have one tag. Ex; <hr /> adds a horizontal line.
8. Semantic markup is using elements that not only change the way the texts looks, but also lets the browser know to emphasize certain words, and identify quotes. These are helpful for screen reader users and search engines.
9. html5 merged the <acronym> element with the <abbr> element. html5 has new elements to divide the body of the page <div>. html5 has <article> that specifies independent, self contained content.
