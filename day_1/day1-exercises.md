//Open the `day1-exercises.md` file you created earlier, and answer these questions about the reading in that file://

1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

  -provides structure which helps readers understand the information that is being presented

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

  [ ] a tag is a general term for the HTML code that is housed by the angled brackets and sometimes include a forward slash
    - tags include the angled brackets themselves, the forward slash (if applicable), and the element in which they contain
    - tags most commonly are found at the beginning (opening tag) and end (closing tag) of each html statement
    - a closing tag is identical to the opening tag except for a forward slash before the element name located inside the brackets

  [ ] an element tells the browser something specific about the information that sits between a set of tags
    - each individual element usually consists of two tags, an opening tag and a closing tag

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

  - provide additional information about the contents of the elements
  - attributes appear inside the opening tag and consist of two parts, a name and a value, separated by an equals sign


4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

  - <head> element includes information about the page that is not visible on the browser window that is accessed by the public
  - <title> elements are usually found within the <head> element, //also referred to as, "wrapped" by the <head> element//
  - <title> elements are usually visible as bits of information used within the URL itself or as the description summarized in the tab heading (if supported by internet browser).

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  - Keyboard shortcut to view the source of a webpage on chrome is 'option + command + u'
  - With a mouse, select 'view', then move cursor over 'Developer' and then click on 'View Source'

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

  - <html></html> is the markup element which tells the browser which markup language was used to annotate the text
  - <h1></h1> is a heading element which have 6 different levels, 1 being the highest, and labeled as a Main Heading
  - <h6></h6> is also a heading element, but with 6 being the lowest of the levels, the formatting would be smallest sized font of all the 6 levels, and labeled as a Level 6 Heading
  - <b></b> is a bold element, which makes whichever characters are inside the <b> and </b> tags appear bold
  - <sup></sup> is the superscript element telling the browser the characters inside these brackets should be superscript

7.  What are empty elements?

  - Elements that do not include both an opening and closing tag, but instead consist of a single tag at which the element inside the angled brackets is usually followed by a space and a forward slash character

8.  What is semantic markup?

  - Tags that provide extra information
    - examples of semantic markup:
      - where emphasis is placed in a sentence
      - that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it)
      - the meaning of acronyms

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

  - <section></section> is the section element, it groups together content that is related and each <section> element usually has its own header
  - <figure></figure>n is the figure element, it contains content referenced from the main flow of an article, and doesn't have to be an image
  - <figcaption></figcaption> is the figcaption element, which contains a textual description of the <figure> element's content
