1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML describes the structure of a webpage, and provides content (text, image, audio, or visual) that will be displayed within tags and elements.

2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?

Elements represent the entirety of the opening tag, closing tag, and content within. Tags are the opening and closing containers that, when wrapped around text or content, create an element.

3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They are used to provide additional context or specificity to an element.

4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

The head element is used to host information about the page, and isn't displayed in the browser. Information in the head is generally related to title, language. meta content, and SEO/crawl-friendly information.

The title element specifies the title of the page, which is shown on the browser tab or at the top of the browser window.

The body element hosts the content that is displayed in the browser window.


5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

Right click > View Page Source, OR

View > Developer > View Page Source

6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

<h1>H1 is the highest-level heading.</h1>

<hr> HR inserts a horizontal ruler on the page.

<a href="http://google.com/">The a tag is for links. This one goes to Google.</a>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/CSS3_taxonomy_and_status-v2.png/1201px-CSS3_taxonomy_and_status-v2.png" height="50" width="50" alt="CSS image"> The img tag displays an image, and requires a src attribute.

B or strong tags are used to <strong>create bold text</strong>.


7. What are empty elements?

Empty elements are HTML elements that typically only require one tag, such as hr and br tags.

8. What is semantic markup?

Semantic markup provides extra information about the context of information on a page—such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, if something is a quotation, or if a piece of content is an article. Semantic markup is useful for screen reading applications, SEO, and collaboration, since creating markup that is semantically readable will assist in indexing and crawlability, and will help others better understand what the intention of a page or code block is.

9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

Header, footer, nav, and section are all new HTML5 elements that can greatly assist in creating better semantic markup.
