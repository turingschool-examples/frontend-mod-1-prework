# HTML & CSS Day 1 Reading
**1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**
The purpose of HTML is to allow users to format their website so that it is easier to read.

**2 What is the difference between an element and a tag?**
An element is the opening tag, the closing tag and all of the info between the two tags. A tag opens or closes an element. (`<p>`, `<body>`)

**3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**
We use attributes to provide extra information about the elements contents.

**4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**
The `<head>` element is displayed outside of the main browser, typically at the top of the browser or open tab. It is used to provide information about the page.
The `<title>` is typically located inside of the <head> element. It will display the title of the page or info regarding the page.
The `<body>` element displays everything that you see inside of the browser page.


**5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**
To view the page source you right click and select "view page source".

**6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.**
- The `h1` element is used to make a headline. It bolds the text and makes the font size larger.
- The `<b>` element makes the text inclosed inside of the opening and closing tag appear bold.
- The `<sup>` element is used to display information in superscript format. For example `10<sup>th</sup>`.
-  The `<blockquote>` element is typically used for longer quotes. It will typically indent the quote. A `<p>` tag is still used to enclose the quote.
- The `<ins>` element is used to cross out information on a page. It is commonly used with the `<del>` element. An add would be a good example of using `<ins>` and `<del>`. Was $999 now its $1!

**7. What are empty elements?**
Elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. `<br />` in an example of an empty element.

**8. What is semantic markup?**
Semantic markup shares information about the page as opposed to changing the layout. Denoting a quote or a citation would be an example of semantic markup.

**9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.**
* The `<aside>` element will contain information that is related to but not essential to a page or an article.  
* The `<nav>` element is used to contain major navigational blocks on a site. It is not used for things like links to related posts.
* The `<header>` & `<footer>` elements are used to create the main header or footer that are on the top and bottom of every page on the site.
