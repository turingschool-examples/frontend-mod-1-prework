# Day 1 Exercises
## Chapter 1 & 2

### 1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

  To create and outline the structure of web pages which will then be interpreted by a users web browser. It can also be used to fill out some basic content of the page.

### 2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

  A tag specifies what type of content you're working with between the brackets, or what you want to happen to it. An element is a similar term, but refers to not just the initial tag (say the < b > tag to indicate to bold the text that follows), but also the closing tag and the content inside the tag.

### 3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

  Attributes provide additional information on a tag, either for functional or descriptive purposes. They allow for greater functional capacity without having an excessive list of tags.

### 4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

  A Body element is an element used to encompass everything that will be shown in the main browser window. The Title element on the other hand is used to indicate only the text that will be shown in the title bar. The Head element generally nests within the Body element and will often be filled with descriptive information on the page.

### 5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  Ctrl + Click -> View Page Source

### 6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

  - `<b></b>` is used to Bold the containing text
  - `<br />` is ued to indicate a line break
  - `<i></i>` is used to italicize the encapsulated text
  - `<h[1-6]></h[1-6]>` is used to indicate the content between tags is a header, with various levels of header achievable by passing in a value from 1 to 6. These fit into a hierarchy accordingly, with `<h1></h1>` being the top level.  
  - `<blockquote></blockquote>` is used to block out larger chunks of text, browsers generally indent the content placed between these tags.


### 7.  What are empty elements?

  Empty elements are elements which generally do not have content between an open and closing tag. They generally consist only of a single tag, containing a space and a forward slash. An example would be `<hr />` which creates a break in the content with a line, or `<br />` mentioned before.

### 8.  What is semantic markup?

  Semantic markup is used to add additional information or stylization to the page or it's content, rather than laying out the structure of the page.

### 9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

  The `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` elements were all introduced to help developers describe the layout of a page
