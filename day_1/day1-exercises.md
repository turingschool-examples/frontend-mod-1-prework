1. HTML adds structure to web pages so that the page will appear a particular way.  
2. An element includes the opening tag, closing tag, and the information in between the two. Tags are the characters that are surrounded by brackets.
3. Attributes provided additional information about an element.
4. The `<head>` element provides information about the page itself. The `<title>` tag provides the title of the web page, which is shown above the page itself and in its specific tab. The `<body>` element tells the browser that everything within it should be displayed inside the main browser window.
5. You can view the source by right clicking on the page and clicking "view page source."
6. `<h1>` is used to indicate the main heading. `<b>` bolds text. `<i>` italicizes text. `<sub>` indicates text that should be subscript. `<br>` creates a line break.
7. Empty elements only have one tag.
8. Semantic markup provides extra information to the web page without providing structure.
9. Three new semantic elements are `<header>`, `<figcaption>`, and `<section>`.
