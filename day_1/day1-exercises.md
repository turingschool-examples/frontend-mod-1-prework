# Day 1 Exercises

## Chapter 1 & 2 Questions
1) On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
* HTML describes the structure of the page.

2) What is the difference between an element and a tag?
* The elements are the angled brackets that the characters of HTML code live between. Elements describe the structure of the webpage.

* Tags tell the computer where the information begins (starting with the opening tag ``<HTML code>``) and where it ends (the closing tag ``</HTML code>``) and act as containers.

3) Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
* We use attributes because they provide us with additional information about the contents of an element.

4) Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
* The head element contains information about the page, and is not displayed in the main part of the browser. Typically the title element is found within the head element.

* The title element displays information at the top of the browser, or on the tab for that page. This is not found in the main part of the browser.

* The body element then displays everything on the main browser window, and often contains many elements within it, such as headers, paragraphs, images, etc.

5) In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
* Click on the 'View' menu from the browser bar, then select 'Developer' and then 'View Source'. You can also view this using the keyboard shortcut option + command + U

6) List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, ``<p></p>`` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
* ``<b></b>`` is a bold element and makes characters appear bold. It represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way.
* ``<i></i>`` is an italic element and makes characters appear italic. It is used to represent a section of text that would be said differently from the surrounding content. For example, technical terms, foreign words, thoughts, and more.
* ``<sup></sup>`` is the superscript element and is used to contain characters that should be superscript. It can be used for suffixes of dates (th,rd) or mathematical concepts (raising a number to a power).
* ``<sub></sub>`` is the subscript element and is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It can be used for footnotes or chemical formulas.
* ``<br />`` is the line break element and is used if you want to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph.

7) What are empty elements?
* Empty elements only have one tag, and are closed by a space and a forward slash before the closing angled bracket.

8) What is semantic markup?
* Semantic markups add additional information to the contents of the page without affecting the structure. For example, where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something is a quote, etc. They should not be used to change the way that the text looks, but rather be used to describe the content of your page more accurately.

9) What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
* ``<header>`` is the new header element
* ``<nav>`` is the the new navigation element
* ``<article>`` is the new article element
