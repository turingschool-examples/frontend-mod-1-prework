1. HTML describes the structure of pages
2. Elements are the characters that make up HTML code. They live inside of angled brackets, which are the tags (an opening and closing tag). Each element tells the browser about the information that is inside of the opening and closing tags, and the tags act like containers where they tell you about the information that is between them. For example, tags of `<h1> and </h1>` would tell you that the information between the tags is a main header. Tag and element are often used interchangeably, however, strictly speaking, the element actually comprises both the opening and closing tags and the content that lies between them.
3. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They will appear in the opening tag of the element, and are made up of both a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
4. Everything within the body element will be shown in the main browser window. The head element is typically before the body element, and shows information about the page, rather than information about what is shown within the main browser window. The title element is usually inside of the head element, and these contents are either shown in the top of the browser or on the tab for the page.
5. You click the 'View' tab and then go down to 'Developer' and click 'View Source'.
6. `<h1></h1>` is a heading and used for main headings
  `<b></b>` is used to make characters appear bold
  `<i></i>` is used to make characters appear italic
  `<br />` will add a line break
  `<sub></sub>` is used to contain characters that should be subscript
7. Empty elements usually only have one tag. They do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there is usually a space and a forward slash character.
8. Semantic markup is when you include text elements that do not affect the structure of your web pages, but they add extra information to the pages.  
9. Three new semantic elements in HTML5 are: `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`
