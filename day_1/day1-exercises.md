# Day 1: HTML and CSS

### Chapters 1 - 2 on Structure and Text

#### 1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
The purpose of HTML is to create the structure of a website. HTML tells the browser what content should be a paragraph, what should be an image, etc. This creates the structure and layout of a webpage. HTML also is used for accessibility for screen readers, etc.

#### 2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
Elements are blocks of text or content wrapped by code. Tags are the code used to tell the browser what type of content is in the element. For example `<p>This is a paragraph</p>` is a paragraph element. `<p>` and `</p>` are the tags that describe the element to the browser.

#### 3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes are used to add additional information to elements. They can hold certain values that may give more functionality to and HTML element. For example `<p lang="en-us">` is a paragraph tag with a language attribute telling the browser what language it is.

#### 4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The head element holds information about the web page. It can also connect to other files such as CSS of JavaScript files. The title is the name of the page. The title generally lives inside the head element. The body holds the main content of the page. Everything inside the body tag will be visible on the page.

#### 5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
To view the source of a website you press cmnd + option + U. This will show you all the code used to makeup that page.

#### 6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
1. `<h1></h1>` are used to represent the first heading of the document.
2. `<img>` is an image element. This allows an image to be displayed on a page.
3. `<a href="#"></a>` is an anchor tag. This creates a link to somewhere else in the document or a different page.
4. `<span></span>` is a span tag that is mainly used to wrap bits of content. This allows you to add extra styling to a smaller peice of content.
5. `<article></article>` is the article tag. This is used to wrap the main article of a web page.

#### 7. What are empty elements?
Empty elements are elements that cannot have any child nodes of nested elements. For example an `<img>` element is an empty element, because you cannot nest code inside of an image element. Empty elements also do not have a closing tag.

#### 8. What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup is the practice of writing descriptive code using the correct elements. Semantic markup describes the type of content to the browser. This can help with accessibility such as screen readers. For example a `<p>` tag tells the the content inside is a paragraph. The `<blockquote>` tag tells the browser that what ever is inside the tag is a blockquote.

#### 9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
1. `nav` is used on the primary navigation.
2. `article` is used to wrap around blog content or the main content of the page or section. There can be multiple articles on a page.
3. `aside` is used to describe related content to the article. This can contain relevant links or more information about the article.
