1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  * Describes the structure of webpages
2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  * An element includes the tag (opening and closing) and everything in between, while the tag is strictly what's between the left/right angle brackets.
3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  * We use them because they provide more information about what an element contains.
4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  * The head element contains info about the page and NOT the information shown on the webpage.
  * The title element is shown in the top of the browser above the url or on the tab of the page.
  * The body element has everything that is shown on the webpage.   
5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  * Right click and then click on view page source.
6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for.  For example,`` <p></p>`` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  * `<h1></h1>`: is a heading element used for main headings and is the largest heading element
  * `<b></b>`: makes text between tags bold
  * `<i></i>`: makes text italicized
  * `<sup></sup>`: contains characters that should be       superscript
  * `<br />`: adds in line breaks
7. What are empty elements?
  * Empty elements don't have words between the opening and closing tags.  They usually only have one tag, and the line break element `(<br />)`.
8. What is semantic markup?
  * Text elements that don't affect the structure of a webpage but do add more info to the pages.
9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
  * `<header>`: might be used to contain the title or date of a blogpost
  * `<nav>`: contains the major navigational blocks on a site
  * `<articles>`: a container for any section of a page that can stand alone or be grouped
