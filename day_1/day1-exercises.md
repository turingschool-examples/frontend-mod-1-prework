1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
        -The purpose of HTML code on a website is the text. It is also used for creating links between webpages inside the initial web index. It is also used to put images, videos, or sound clips onto the webpage.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
        -An example of a tag would be
        p /p. An element would be the tag and any content inside the tags.
        p text /p


3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
        -Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.
        ex: p lang="en"
        lang is the attribute name and en is the attribute value.


4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
        -The head element contains information about the page. This information will not be visible to users. The only thing visible to users inside the head will be the title element. The title element will contain the title of the page. This will appear visible to the user on the tab section in a web browser. The body element is what is visible to the user. The body is where the code displays in the web browser.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
        -Click the view tab, then go to developer. After this click view source. This will create a new tab and will show the code of the webpage. I personally prefer doing something different. I prefer clicking the 3 vertical dots in the top right hand corner, going to more tools, then selecting developer tools. This allows to play around with the website and see changes in action. I found this helpful when trying to design the page mainly involving colors.


6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
    1. footer - this element is used to be the last thing on the web page. It still exists in the body element however the footer will be used to signify a display at the bottom of the web page.
    2. div - div is a container. It takes up all available horizontal space. I found this element amazing for establishing id's and classes for CSS purposes. As well as reading purposes.
    3. span similar to div however span does not take up all horizontal space and only takes up the space the element uses.
    4. img puts images on your webpage.
    5. ul unordered list - This element creates a bullet point list. Use li to declare a list item in said list.



7.  What are empty elements?
      -Empty elements are elements that do not contain any text. They also are a self closing tag. An example of this would be hr / this element creates a break in the text and also adds a horizontal line to the web page to separate content.

8.  What is semantic markup?
      -These are elements that are used to add "flavor" to the page. By that I mean bolds, italics, quotes, underlines, etc. These element do contain text inside them but the tags will do something to that text.


9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
      1. nav Creates a navigation bar to navigate to sub pages of a website.
      2. aside Creates a vertical side bar on the page and can contain information about the entire page. If inside a container then it should contain information about what is in the container.
      3. header similar to footer, this element is used to create a container at the top of the webpage as where <footer> is for the bottom of the webpage.



So why does a tag not show in git when i upload it? Makes this weird.Any time you something that should be an element just insert a < > for it please.
