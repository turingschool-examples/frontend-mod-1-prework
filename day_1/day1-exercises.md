<h3><p> Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?</h3>

<p><h3> Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.</h3></p>
      <b><i>Body</b>- Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.</i>
       <br><b><i>Head</b>- Typically goes before body element. It contains info about the page rather that information shown within the main part of the browser window.
       <br><i><b>Title</b>- title element typically lives inside head element. The contents of the title element is shown in the top of the browser above where URL is shown. Or it will show as the name of the tab in the browser.  </i>

<p><h3> In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?</h3></p>
 <i>Either use short cut which is Shift + Control + C (PC) or Shift + Cmd + C (MAC) or right click on page and click inspect.

<p><h3> What are empty elements?</h3></p>
<i> Empty elements are elements that dont have a closing tag. Example of an empty element is < br >. Its a line break element and does not require a closing tag.

<p> <h3>What is semantic markup?</h3></p>
      <i>There are two types of markup. One is Structural- includes elements that let you define paragraphs and headings. The other one is Semantic- provides extra information on the content. These elements do not affect the structure of the web page but are there for extra information and emphasis. </i>

  <i> &lt;nav&gt; , &lt;aside&gt; , &lt;footer&gt; , &lt;article&gt;. These elements are used to let authors of web pages have an easier and more universal way to organize content on web pages. Also this helps search engines and screen readers to to easier target sections of web pages. </i>
