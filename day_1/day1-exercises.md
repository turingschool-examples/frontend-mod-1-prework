## Day 1


### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
* From page 20, "HTMl describes the structure of of pages on a website", much like the structure we would use on any document we created on Microsoft Word, a form, or correspondence with someone. It's the "bones" of a page or site.

### What is the difference between an element and a tag?
* While sometimes used interchangeably, an element differs from a tag in that an element is compromised of tags and the content that lies in between them. Page 24

### Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
* The attributes contain additional information about the element's content. Page 25

### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
* The head contains information about the page, rather than what's on the main browser. The title is in the head element, and can also be found in the tab for the page. The content in the main browser window is contained in the body attribute. Page 27

### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
* To view the source of a site on Chrome, I use the keys "Cmd + Opt + U".

### List five different HTML elements and what they are used for.
1. <b></b> makes characters bold
2. <sup></sup> makes the characters superscript.
3. <i></i> makes characters italicized
4. <sub></sub> makes characters subscript
5. <h1></h1> makes the characters into the largest heading. There are 6 sizes of headings.
pages 43-46

### What are empty elements?
* An empty element only has one tag and there will often be a space and forward slash. Page 48

### What is semantic markup?
* Semantic markup is used to describe the content of your web pages more accurately, for example, for screen readers and search engines. Page 50

### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5?
* <nav> </nav> for primary site navigation;
* <article></article> for any stand-alone or possibly syndicated section of a page that is an individual piece of content;
* <aside> </aside> which has two uses: 1) when in the article element, it's used for related but not necessary info of the article; and 2) when outside of article, it is a container of info for the entire page. Page 436
