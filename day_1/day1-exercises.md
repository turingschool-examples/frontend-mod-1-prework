# HTML & CSS Day 1 Reading
..1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
The purpose of HTML is to allow users to format their website so that it is easier to read.
..2 What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element is the opening tag, the closing tag and all of the info between the two tags. A tag opens or closes an element. (`<p>`, `<body>`)
..3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
We use attributes to provide extra information about the elements contents.
..4 Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The `<head>` element is displayed outside of the main browser, typically at the top of the browser or open tab. It is used to provide information about the page.
The `<title>` is typically located inside of the <head> element. It will display the title of the page or info regarding the page.
The `<body>` element displays everything that you see inside of the browser page.
..5 In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
To view the page source you right click and select "view page source".
..6 List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
* The `<h1>` element is used to make a headline. It bolds the text and makes the font size larger.
* The `<b>' element makes the text inclosed inside of the opening and closing tag appear bold.
* The `<sup>` element is used to display information in superscript format. For example `10<sup>th</sup>`.
* The `<blockquote>` element is typically used for longer quotes. It will typically indent the quote. A `<p>` tag is still used to enclose the quote.
* The `<ins>` element is used to cross out information on a page. It is commonly used with the `<del>` element. An add would be a good example of using `<ins>` and `<del>`. Was $999 now its $1!
..7. What are empty elements?
Elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. `<br />` in an example of an empty element.
..8. What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup shares information about the page as opposed to changing the layout. Denoting a quote or a citation would be an example of semantic markup.
..9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
* The `<aside>` element will contain information that is related to but not essential to a page or an article.  
* The `<nav>` element is used to contain major navigational blocks on a site. It is not used for things like links to related posts.
* The `<header>` & `<footer>` elements are used to create the main header or footer that are on the top and bottom of every page on the site.
