## 1 - On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML creates the structure and foundation of a webpage.

## 2 - What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags. Tags are the containers that sit at the beginning and end of this information, denoted by left angle and right angle brackets.

## 3 - Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.

## 4- Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The head contains information about the page rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser. The title contains the information that will be displayed in the tab or above the url bar. The body element will display everything that is shown within the main browser window.

## 5 - In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
On Windows devices, right click a page and click "Inspect" in the pop up menu or use the Ctrl + Shift + I keyboard shortcut. On Mac devices, the keyboard shortcut is Command + Option + I.

## 6 - List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
<h1-h6></h1-h6> - Headings elements. Used to display headings at different sizes, <h1> being the larges and <h6> being the smallest.
<p></p> - A paragraph element. Represents a paragraph of text. By default a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
<b></b> - Bold text. Characters will appear bold when contained within these tags.
<i></i> - Italic text. Characters will appear italic when contained within these tags.
<br /> - Line Break. Text listed after the <br /> tag will appear on the next line with no space between it and the line above it.

## 7 - What are empty elements?
Empty elements are elements that do not have any words between the opening and closing tag. Usually an empty element has only one tag.

## 8 - What is semantic markup?
Text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the page.

## 9 - What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
