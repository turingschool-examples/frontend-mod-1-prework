1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

    * HTML give structure to a page, which includes using headings, subheadings and paragraphs which creates a hierarchy for the information.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

    * Elements are made up of tags (usually an opening and closing tag) and the content that is between them. The character inside the tag indicates the tag’s purpose.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

    * Attributes provide additional information about the contents of the element, consisting of a name and value. It’s the opening tag that can hold an attribute.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

    * The head element contains information about the page and is not shown within the main part of the browser. The title element is usually inside the head element. The contents inside the title element will appear in the title bar/tabs at the top of the browser. This information is also important for SEO purposes and includes metadata. The contents inside the body element is what is shown inside the main browser window.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

    * To view the source of a website (in Chrome) all you have to do is right click and click on “View Page Source”.

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

    * `<h1></h1>` is used for main headings. There are six levels of headings, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. H2 and so on are used for subheadings. The contents of the `<h1>` element is the largest and the contents of the `<h6>` element is the smallest.
    * `<b></b>` makes characters bold.
    * `<i></i>` makes characters italic.
    * `<sup></sup>` contains characters that should be superscript.
    * `<sub></sub>` contains characters that should be subscript.

7.  What are empty elements?

    * An empty element is an element that doesn’t have any words between the opening and closing tag, and usually only have one tag. There will often be a space before the forward slash and closing angled bracket. Examples of empty elements include a line break `<br />` and a horizontal rule `<hr />`.

8.  What is semantic markup?

    * Semantic markup provides extra meaning/information. Semantic elements tell you information about the content between the opening and closing tags. Semantic markup is also helpful for SEO, screen readers, and makes it easier for other web developers to read.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

    * Three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5 include:
      * `<header>` (contains the header)
      * `<nav>` (contains the navigation)
      * `<article>` (contains articles)
    * These new elements help describe the structure of the page, rather than using `<div>` elements and class or id attributes to indicate their role. The new elements also affect search engine weight and make the code easier to follow.
