1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML code basically describes how a website is arranged, or structured. It defines which text will be considered a header, paragraph, etc.

2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?

An element defines on the website what the information in between it is. A tag initiates and finishes an element. An example of this is:
```<h1>This is a header</h1>```
The element would be a header, and the tags are the bracketed items surrounding the header text.

3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

Attributes describe characteristics of an element. This can include specific languages, sizes, etc. Each attribute will have a name and a value, saying what the attribute is and its unique characteristics.

4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

Head- Describes information about the page not shown within the browser window.
Title- Located within the Head element, text within title brackets will show up above the browser window.
Body- Content found within the browser window. Contains headers, paragraphs, etc.

5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

View -> Developer -> View Source or command+option+u, this will then open up a new window that shows how the website is built. This can be a valuable resource for showing specific examples made by veteran developers.

6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

Headings- ```<h1></h1>```Text typically larger than the paragraph text (6 different levels) used to describe what is in the subsequent data. Similar to a title within the head.
Bold- ```<b></b>``` Makes the surrounding text visually bolder, similar to the command+b function in other applications.
Italics- ```<i></i>``` Italicizes the surrounding text, similar to the command_i function in other applications.
Line Breaks- ```<br />``` Manually creates a new line of text, similar to hitting the Enter command in other applications.
Horizontal Rules-``` <hr /> ```Creates a horizontal line in between desired text. Usually used to designate changes in subject.

7. What are empty elements?

An element that does not have an opening and closing tag. Like line breaks and Horizontal rule, once the single tag has been input, the command is both opened and closed.

8. What is semantic markup?

Elements not used solely for the purpose of presentation, instead semantic markup provides more in depth meaning to the data wrapped in a semantic markup. ```<strong>``` and ```<em>``` are examples of semantic markups.

9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

<nav> creates a navigation tool to a browser used for searching material.
<article> act similar to the paragraph function, but does not have to be uniquely called out as a div class.
<aside> forms a sidebar typically used for bullet points and lists.
