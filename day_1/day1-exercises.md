## Day-1 Questions
### Chapters 1 & 2
#### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML code is used on websites in order to create the structure of the website and to determine how the information is presented to the user.  

#### What is the difference between an element and a tag?

An element usually consists of two tags and is used to communicate information to the browser about the information contained within it.  Therefore a tag is just a part of an element, and a tag is something that is contained within the < and > symbols with the closing tag also including a / to denote that it's a closing tag. The tags are used as containers to show which information will be included in the element.  

#### Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

Attributes are used in HTML to reveal additional information about that element which can be used to communicate to the browser important details regarding that element such as the language that it's being communicated in.  In order for attributes to be included, it requires an attribute name and value to be denoted.

#### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

The purpose of the head is to communicate information about that webpage and what it's purpose or function might be.  This information isn't necessarily what's shown on the browser's webpage but often it includes an element called the title element.  A title element, much like the head element, communicates information that is about the webpage rather than what appears in the webpage on the browser.  The title is usually an element that communicates a title name given to the webpage and this information appears at the top of browser window itself, even above where the website address is shown.  As for the body element, the purpose of this is to determine what information will be shown to the user accessing the website.  It is contained inside the browser window and is the information that website visitor's are coming to the page for.

#### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

To view the source of a website you can go to the top of the browser and access the menu titled 'view' and go down to the 'developer' option and from there you can click view source.  Alternatively, you can right click inside the webpage and click on the 'inspect' button and that will bring you to an area where you can view the source of the website as well as other information about the webpage.

####     List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

    <body></body> is a body element that is used to show which information will be contained and displayed to the user accessing the website.
    <title></title> is an element that determines what information will be included in the area designated as the title of the webpage which is displayed at the top of the browser window rather than inside the browsers webpage.  
    <h1></h1> is a heading element that is used to show what information will be in the first level of headings on the webpage.  This is also referred to as the main heading.
    <h2></h2> is also a heading element but it represents what information will be included in a sub-heading of the webpage.  There are different levels of headings in most webpages and this is the one that is one level lower than the main heading.
    <b></b> is the bold element and it determines that the information contained within it's tags will be bolded on the webpage.

#### What are empty elements?

Empty elements are elements which don't use an opening and closing tag.  These elements contain one tag and that is used to communicate the information that it's used for without having to be contained around other text.  Many empty element tags are contained between the slanted brackets with a space and / before the closing slanted bracket.  

#### What is semantic markup?

Semantic markups are elements that are used in HTML to describe information about particular areas or information in the webpage and although some semantic markup elements might affect how the information contained is presented on the webpage, it's main function is supposed to be explaining information about that section or information instead of changing how it's presented.  These semantic markups are important for features such as screen readers because it can alter how the screen reader communicates the information it is reading off.  

#### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

    <strong></strong> elements are used to designate which information is considered relatively important and will be emphasized by a screen reader with a strong emphasis.  It also has the second affect of bolding that information.
    <em></em> element is used to designate which information should be emphasized and this will cause a screen reader to slightly alter the emphasis they put on reading this section.  It also has the second affect of italicizing that text.
    <blockquote></blockquote> elements are used to describe what information is a quotation and typically what information would be considered a relatively long quote that consists of an entire paragraph or more.  The second affect of this element is that it will indent that particular text.
