1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
    HTML code controls the structure of the website. Tags and elements tell you the hierarchy of information (as in, a header is more important and will be displayed more prominently than a paragraph) as well as information about the contents of the page.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
    An element includes a start tag, attributes, and (usually) an end tag, as well as any content in between the start and end tags. Tags are used to structure the content of an element. For example, the H1 tag will make content appear as a heading.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
    In HTML elements, attributes give extra information about an element's content. One example given by the text is an attribute that tells us that the content is written in English.
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
    The head and title elements are not displayed in the body of the web browser but contain information about the page. The head tag contains all of the head elements, including the title. The title element includes the title of the page to be displayed at the top of the tab or window. The body element contains the content of the page that will be displayed by the browser (images, paragraphs, headers, etc.).
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
    To see the source of any website on Chrome, you right click and then select "View page source".
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
    <h1> </h1> - Header 1 element used to represent the largest and most prominent header.
    <b> </b> or <strong> </strong> - Bold text element used to make the text between the tags bold.
    <br> - Line break element adds a single line break. Note that it is an empty tag and does not require a closing tag.
    <div> </div> - The div element creates a division or section of code that can be altered separately from the surrounding code.
    <img> - The image element inserts an image. You need the image source url (src) and an alternate description of the image (alt).
7.  What are empty elements?
    Empty elements are elements with no content and no end tag. For example, <br> is the entire element for a line break and does not require any content or a closing tag to display properly.
8.  What is semantic markup?
    Semantic markup gives extra information that helps communicate the meaning of a page and its content to the browser. By definition, semantic markup doesn't add structure to a page (though some elements are both semantic and structural).
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
    <header> - The new header element tells the browser that the content is a header.
    <footer> - The new footer element tells the browser that the content is a footer.
    <article> - The new article element distinguishes the content as independent and self-contained (as in, it could be read and understood without the context of the rest of the website).
