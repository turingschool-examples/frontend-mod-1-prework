1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  - HTML code is the structure of the web page. It sets up how the page will be laid out.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  - Elements are part of the code that say what it is structuring, while Tags are just parts of the elements that open and close the structure. So elements consist of opening and closing tags. The element is the big picture while the tags are the pieces of the puzzle.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  - Attributes give us further information about the elements. The attribute name tells us what information it is giving and the attribute value is the setting for the attribute.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  - Head tells us about the page. Goes above any paragraph and tells us what the page is about.
  - Title indicates just that, the title of the page. Displayed in the top tab above the URL, this sets the standard for the main point of the page.
  - Body indicates what is to be displayed in the main browser window

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  - You can go to the top and click 'view' then go to 'developer' and then 'view source' or you can click command+Option+U to get the same results.

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  - html is a tag to tell the user that everything between these tags is in HTML code
  - body says that the contents should be shown in the main browser on the web page
  - h1 indicates a main heading
  - p indicates that anything between the tags is a part of a paragraph
  - h2 is for sub headings. These can also go on past 2 as well

7.  What are empty elements?
  - Empty elements are those that don't have a closing tag but instead are 'self-closing'. For instance, the <br /> tag indicates a line break but it doesn't need a </br> to close it.

8.  What is semantic markup?
  - Semantic markup is for conveying  extra information. Could be used for emphasis, quotes, meaning, etc.
