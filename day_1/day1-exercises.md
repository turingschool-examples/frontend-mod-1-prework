# Day 1: HTML & CSS

# Chapters 1 & 2

# 1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
**Answer:**
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) provides the structure or "skeleton" of a website. It gives the web browser info regarding headings, text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash etc. Every web page is built from HTML. In addition to HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and/or Javascript can be added to stylize and provide additional website functions.

# 2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
**Answer:**
An element is an entire line of code made up of content with a tag. Most tags include two parts, an opening tag `<h1>` and a closing tag `</h1>`. The content is stored between the tags. Some tags are self closing and do not require a second closing tag to operate.

# 3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
**Answer:**
Attributes are values added to HTML elements to add more information about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and value. Here is an example: `lang='en-us'`. In the example, the attribute name is `lang` for language and the value is `en-us` for United States English.

# 4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
**Answer:**
The head, title, and body elements are used to organize information. The head element usually contains a title element within it. The title element provides the web browser with title information for the webpage. This information isn't displayed directly on the page, but is typically found in the tab of the webpage among other places.

# 5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
**Answer:**
In Chrome you can view a webpage's source code by right clicking on the website and selecting "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML code that makes up the website.

# 6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
**Answer:**<br>
`<h1></h1>` is used to define the main heading of a webpage<br>
`<b></b>` is used to make the content between the tags **bold**<br>
`<i></i>` is used to make the content between the tags *italicized*<br>
`<sup></sup>` is used to define content that is superscript<br>
`<sub></sub>` is used to define content that is subscript<br>

# 7. What are empty elements?
**Answer:**
Empty elements are the few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Here is an example: `<hr />`.

# 8. What is semantic markup?
**Answer:**
Semantic markups are elements that are not intended to affect the structure of a web page, but do add extra information to the page. One reason for semantic markup is to assist screen readers or search engines. For example, the voice of a screen reader may add emphasis to the words inside the `<em>` element, or a search engine might register that your page features a quote if you use the `<blockquote>` element.

# 9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
**Answer:**
Here are 13 new semantic elements introduced in HTML5:<br>
`<article>`<br>
`<aside>`<br>
`<details>`<br>
`<figcaption>`<br>
`<figure>`<br>
`<footer>`<br>
