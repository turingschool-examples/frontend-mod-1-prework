1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
HTML provides the structure and organization for the webpage as well as creating "clickable" words. This makes it easier for the viewer to read and understand. It also helps other developers know what is going on when they view the source.

2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
An element is the command or information you are communicating to the browser. The element is made up of tags as well as the content between the tags. The tags help identify where the command or information begins and ends. The end tag is identified with a forward slash.

3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
Attributes are used to provide additional information about the content within the element. Attributes are located in the opening tag.

4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
The head element is used to provide information that will show up in your tabs. This makes it easier to identify what you are looking for when you have multiple tags open.
The title element is usually found within the head. It appears on tabs and in the header above where you type the URL
The body element indicates what is shown inside the main browser window.

5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
-<h1></h1> is the main heading element. It uses the largest text of all the heading elements.
-<b></b> is a bold text element. It makes the text between the tags bold but does not imply any other additional meaning like <strong> would.
-<sup></sup> this element is used to identify superscript. It helps to properly notate things such as dates.
-<i></i> the content between this tag will appear italicized. It can also be used to identify texts that needs to stand out from the surrounding text.
-<sub></sub> is used to identify characters that should be a subscript.

7. What are empty elements?
Empty elements do not have content in between the opening and closing tags, as a result they are written differently. They only have one tag and include a space and /before you close the angled bracket. <br /> and <hr /> are examples of empty elements.

8. What is semantic markup?
Semantic markup allows you to add additional information to your page but they do not change the structure. This makes it so that screen readers and search engines can use the extra information.

9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
<header> <article> and <footer> are all new elements in HTML5. These new elements help streamline the way the browser interacts with outside programs such as a search engine or a screen reader. They describe the structure of the page and help the outside source identify importance.
