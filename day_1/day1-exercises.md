1. The purpose of HITML code is it will describe the structure of the page when using the code.

2. The differences between an element and a tag are as follows; elements tell the BROWSER something about the information that sits between these "containers", while tags are the "containers" and will tell YOU something about the information. Tags consist of a an opening and closing container that will let the browser know that the text (elements) that are inside the tags need to be changed.

3. We use attributes in HTML elements because attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. These elements are made up of two parts a name and a value. The name indicates what kind of information you are supplying about the element content while the value is the information of that attribute.

4. The purposes of the head, title, and body HTML elements is this; the head contains the information about the page. You will find the head element, using the head tags, before the body element and you will usually find the title element inside the head element. The title element is shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL. Anything written in between the title tags will appear there. The body element has all the information that is shown in the main browser window. You must use the body tags to trap all the elements in to make the text show in this location. All of these HTML elements must have opening and closing tags to make these work.

5. When viewing the source of a website you must start off by going to your web browser's View menu, go down to developer, and click on View source. That is how you will view the source.

6. Five different HTML elements are; h1-h6 these represent different sizes of headings, h1 being the largest vs. h6 being the smallest. b makes the elements inside the tag bold. i element makes the elements inside the tag italic. sub element makes the elements inside the tag subscript, i.e, the 2 in H20 is subscript. br / causes line breaks in the middle of a paragraph. Remember, there needs to be opening and closing tags for these elements to work. These are five different HTML elements

7. An empty element is when there is only one tag, no opening or closing tag. These are written differently than other HTML elements. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will be a space and a forward slash character, causing this to be an empty element.

8. Semantic markup provides extra information. An example would be writing something as a quotation to describe who said it. Another example would be describing an abbreviation.

9. The three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5 are header, nav and article. With opening tags around them.
