## Day 1 Questions

1. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

    `console.log("Hello World!");`

1. What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file?

    `//` for a single line comment

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a floating-point number?

    Both integers and floating-point numbers are considered data types in JavaScript.  

    An integer is a whole number value (ranging from negative, zero, to positive) while a float contains a decimal number.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`.

1. How would you log the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    `console.log(animal);`

1. What is concatenation? Use concatenation to log a sentence to the console using the variable `animal`.

    Concatenation is the joining together, or combining, of data types.  For example, a string and a variable can be concatenated by the plus (+) operator, which allows for an output that contains several pieces of information.

    ```
    var animal = "zebra";

    console.log("My favorite animal is a " + animal + ".");
    ```
