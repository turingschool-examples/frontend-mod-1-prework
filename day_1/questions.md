## Day 1 Questions

1. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
  console.log('"Hello World!"');  

Since the string we want includes quotation marks, I used single quotes to demark the string, allowing me to use the double quotes. We could use the '/' as a break character instead.  

1. What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file?  

'//' or a '/*' followed by the comment ended by '*/'. 

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a floating-point number?  

An integer is any number with no decimal. A floating-point number has a decimal and numbers to the right of it.  

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`.  

var animal = '"Zebra"';  

1. How would you log the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?  

console.log(animal);  

1. What is concatenation? Use concatenation to log a sentence to the console using the variable `animal`.  

Concatenation is the process through which variables may be joined together.  

// console.log("Lions eat zebras, but I only chew " + animal + "-stripe gum.");
