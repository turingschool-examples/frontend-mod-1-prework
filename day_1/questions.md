## Day 1 Questions
___

**1. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**

```console.log(" 'Hello World! ")```

**2. What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file?**

 ```//```

**3. Explain the difference between an integer and a floating-point number?**

For simplicities sake, I'll say that an integer is a 'whole' number while a float is either a decimal or a fraction. Even though both include negatives, which aren't technically whole numbers, but yeah.

**4. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`.**

```var animal = "zebra"```

**5. How would you log the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?**

```console.log("zebra")```

**6. What is concatenation? Use concatenation to log a sentence to the console using the variable `animal`.**

A concatenation is a really complex word for the concept of joining things together.

```console.log("The " + animal + " was never domesticated due to their panicky nature.")```
