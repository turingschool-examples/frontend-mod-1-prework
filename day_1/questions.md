## Day 1 Questions

1. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

2. What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file?

    The `//` or `/*my comment*/` characters makes the text "invisible" to the javascript editor.

3. Explain the difference between an integer and a floating-point number?

    An **integer** is a whole number that can be either positive, negative, or zero. Unlike integers, **floating-point numbers** must include floating decimal points and can be either positive or negative.

4. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`.

```javascript
var animal = "zebra";
```

5. How would you log the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```javascript
console.log(animal);
```

6. What is concatenation? Use concatenation to log a sentence to the console using the variable `animal`.

    When referring to JavaScript, **concatenation** is used to join together a string or set of strings by using a `+` operator.

```javascript
var animal = "Zebra";
var feature = "black and white";

console.log(animal + "s are unique because they have " + feature + " stripes.");
```
