1. What is concatenation? Use concatenation to log a sentence to the console using the variable `animal`.

    Concatenation is the joining together, or combining, of data types.  For example, a string and a variable can be concatenated by the plus (+) operator, which allows for an output that contains several pieces of information.

    `var animal = "zebra";`
    `console.log("My favorite animal is a " + animal + ".");`
