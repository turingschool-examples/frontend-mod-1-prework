# Day 2: HTML and CSS

## Open your local copy of frontend-module-0-capstone in Atom

  In the day_2 directory, create another file called `day2-exercises.md`. This is where you'll put your answers to the following questions.

## Read Chapters 3 and 4 on Lists and Links from [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett)

  Answer these questions about the reading in your `day2-exercises.md` file:

  1.  There are three main types of lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. What are their differences?
  2.  What is the basic structure of an element used to link to another website?
  3.  What attribute should you include in a link to open a new tab when the link is clicked?
  4.  How do you link to a specific part of the same page?

  With the page you created in CodePen on Day 1 (that included Structure and Text), add to it:

  *   Two lists: ordered and unordered.
  *   A link to your GitHub account.
  *   A link to the Turing website.

## Read Chapters 10, 11, and 12 on What is CSS, Color, and Text from [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1459879147&sr=8-3&keywords=duckett)

  Answer these questions about the reading in your `day2-exercises.md`:

  1.  What is the purpose of CSS?
  2.  What does CSS stand for? What does cascading mean in this case?
  3.  What is the basic structure of a CSS rule?
  4.  How do you link a CSS stylesheet to your HTML document?
  5.  When is it useful to use external stylesheets as opposed to using interal CSS?
  6.  Describe what a color hex code is.
  7.  What are the three parts of an HSL color property?
  8.  In the world of typeface, what are the three main categories of fonts? What are the differences between them?
  9.  When specifying font-size, what are the main three units used?

  Add to the page you created in CodePen on Day 1:

  *   Add a color to the text of all of your headings (using hex codes).
  *   For your `h1` heading, add a background color.
  *   Make your headings a serif font, and make the paragraph text a sans-serif font.
  *   Change a snippet of paragraph text to be italic using the font-style property (do not use the `<i></i>` in this case).

## For later: Something for Show-and-Tell

  You've notice that we've been building on the same "pen" throughout the mod 0 capstone so far. On day 7, you will spend the day building a completely new site using Atom (not CodePen). You'll take what you've learned throughout days 1-6 and apply it to a completely new webpage. During the first couple days of class, you'll share what you've made on day 7 with your cohort. Just something to keep in mind over these next few days!

## Save your day 2 file in git and push to GitHub
