    You've notice that we've been building on the same "pen" throughout the mod 0 capstone so far. On day 7, you will spend the day building a completely new site using Atom (not CodePen). You'll take what you've learned throughout days 1-6 and apply it to a completely new webpage. During the first couple days of class, you'll share what you've made on day 7 with your cohort. Just something to keep in mind over these next few days!
