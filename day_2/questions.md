## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

```JavaScript
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
```
1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
```
1. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
var woundedAnimal = animals [1];
console.log(woundedAnimal)
//expected output: "giraffe"
console.log(animals.length)
//expected output: 3
```
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

There are two methods we can use to accomplish this result. The first is by using the arr.push() method  or arr.unshift() method.

*This piece of code will add "lion", at the end of the array.*
```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
var carnivore = animals.push("lion");
console.log(carnivore)
//expected output: 4
console.log(animals)
//expected output: ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant", "lion"]
```

**or**

*This piece of code will add "lion", at the beginning of the array.*
```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
var addAnimal = animals.unshift("lion");
console.log(addAnimal)
//expected output: 4
console.log (animals)
//expected output: ["lion", "zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

```
1. Name and describe two additional array methods.
* **arr.pop();** _takes the last element of the array and returns it_, if I apply this method to the last array, it will look something like this.

```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
var sickAnimal = animals.pop();
console.log(sickAnimal)
//expected output: "elephant"
console.log(animals)
//expected output: ["zebra", "giraffe"]
```
* **arr.shift();** _removes first element from and array, and returns it._

```JavaScript
var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"];
var sickAnimal = animals.shift();
console.log(sickAnimal)
//expected output: "zebra"
console.log(animals)
//expected output: ["giraffe", "elephant"]

```

1. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?

A boolean variable can only have two values, true or false. This data type is used to make statements such as yes or no, 1 or 0 ad true or false. It is important to remember that in JS, a variable that contains a value is treated as *true*. "0", "NaN", empty strings, 'undefined' and 'null' are treated as *false*. Boolean allows us to write instructions that are conditioned by one or several factors.
for example: is the apple green?, then if the value of the last question returns "true" the next instructions will be set by the person writing the code. If the apple is green the code can say do this but, if the apple is not green, then do this other thing.
The way I like to conceptualize this data type is by writing my idea and then setting the perspective of the the result I'd like to achieve. This is important for me because sometimes what it might look false to me, might be true for someone else, so perspective is crucial when working with this data types.

1. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

I would create two different variables, one called "num1" and the a second variable called "num2". I would give the variable num1 the value of 2, and to the variable num2 the value of 25. Then I would use the function cosole.log to make the evaluation using this comparison operator (==) t compare the two values (integers) to see if they are the same. The expected output would be false, since we are talking about two datatypes (integers) with two different values.

```JavaScript
var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 25;
console.log(num1 == num2)
//expected output: false
console.log(num1 === num2)
//expected output: false

var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 25;
var result = n1 == n2;
console.log(result);
// expected output: false

var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 25;
var result = n1 <= n2;
console.log(result);
//expected output: true

var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 25;
var result = n1 >= n2;
console.log(result);
//expected output: false
```
1. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

By creating two different variables and then applying (>) "greater than" or (>=) "greater or equal than" as the comparison evaluator.

```JavaScript
var num1 = 25;
var num2 = 2;
console.log(num1 > num2)
//expected output: true
console.log(num1 >= num2)
//expected output: true
```
