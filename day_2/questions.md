## Day 2 Questions

1. Declare a variable named `animals` that stores an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

var animals = ["zebra, "giraffe", "elephant"]

2. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

animals[1];

3. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

animals.push("lion");

4. Name and describe two additional array methods.

pop - Removes the *last* element in an array and returns that element.

shift - Removes the *first* element in an array and returns that element.

5. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?

0 = false

6. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

'2' === '25'
The result comes back false - although they are the same data type, the value of 2 is not equal to 25.

7. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
