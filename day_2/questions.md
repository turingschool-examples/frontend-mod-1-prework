## Day 2 Questions

1. Declare a variable named `animals` that stores an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
var = ["Zebra, "Giraffe", "Elephant"]

2. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
animals[1]

3. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array? animals.push("Lion")

4. Name and describe two additional array methods.
The "pop" method will remove the last elements and return that element only, changing the length of the original array.
The "push" method will add one or more elements to the end of an array and return the new length of the array including the added elements.

5. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?
Boolean values are either true or false

6. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
I would run console.log(2 == 25), which would return a boolean value of false.

7. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
I would run console.log(25 > 2) which would return a boolean value of true.
