## Day 2 Questions

___

**1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.**

```["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]```

**2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.**

```var animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]```

**3. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?**

```console.log(animals[1])```

**4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?**

```var count = animals.push("lion")```

**5. Name and describe two additional array methods.**

The 'fill' method fills an array from one specified point to another with a single element. Ex;

```var dndPartyRaces = ["human", "elf", "dwarf", "halfling", "dragonborn"];```
```console.log(dndPartyRaces.fill("tiefling", 2, 5));```

The expected output of the array is ;

```["human", "elf", "tiefling", "tiefling", "tiefling"]```

**6. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?**

They are statements that are either true or false.

**7. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?**

```var firstVar = 2```
```var secondVar = 25```

```console.log(firstVar == secondVar)```

The result would read false.

**8. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?**

Gonna go by the var values I assigned them to above.

```console.log(secondVar > firstVar)```

The result is true!
