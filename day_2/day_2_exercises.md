1. Three types of lists:  
  -Ordered: The items in these lists need to pertain to a particular order. They can be presented through numbers, letters, roman numerals, etc.  
  -Unordered: The items in these lists to not pertain to any specific order. They can be presented through bullet points.  
  -Definition: These items are typically a series of terms and their definitions. There are two different tags - one for the term and one for the definition.

1. CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can modify things like background color and font with CSS.
2. CSS stands for "cascading style sheet." The idea of cascading refers to the idea that the styles within CSS can fall from one style sheet to the next, creating multiple style sheets within one HTML document.
3. The basic structure of a CSS rule is two different parts: a selector and a declaration. Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
4. To link a CSS stylesheet to your html document, you will use the <link> element to bring in however many style sheet documents you would like.
5. Using external style sheets allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page), keeps the content separate from how the page looks, and means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).
6. Color hex codes are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green, and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash sign.
7. The three parts of an HSL color property are:  
  -Hue: colloquial idea of color.
  -Saturation: amount of gray in a color.  
  -Lightness: amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color.
8. The three main categories of fonts are:  
  -Serif: extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters.  
  -Sans-serif: straight ends to letters, much cleaner design.  
  -Monospace: every letter in a monospace font is the same width.
9. The three main units used in font size are:  
  -Pixels: allow designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up.  
  -Percentages: default size of text in browsers is 16px, so 75% would be equivalent to 12px and 200% would be 32px.  
  -Ems: an em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
