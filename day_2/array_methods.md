# Array Methods

## Pop ()

The `pop()` method is used to remove the last item from an array. It also 'returns' the 'popped' element.

## Push ()

The `push()` method is used to add items to the end of an array and return the new length of the array.

## Shift ()

The `shift()` method works very much like the `pop()` method, the only difference being that the array element that is removed and returned is the **first** one in stead of the **last**.

## Unshift ()

the `unshift()` method works very similarly to the `push()` method, except in stead of adding elements to the **end** of the array, it adds elements to the **beginning** of the array.
