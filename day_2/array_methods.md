# Array Methods

The below Array Methods are forms of Mutator Methods which modify a previously defined array and return a new array.

## An Array Pop Method

A pop removes the last item in an array and returns it. For instance, if you had an array of `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP"]` and you applied a pop method, the new array would become `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat"]`.


## An Array Push Method

A Push adds items to the end of an array and automatically returns the new array length. For instance, if your array was `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP"]`, you could push new items, such as `"Submarine"` and `"Float Plane"` to the end of the array to make it become `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP", "Submarine", "Float Plane"]` and the item length would go from 5 to 7.

## An Array Shift Method

A Shift removes the first item in an array and returns it. For instance, if you had an array of `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP"]` and you applied a shift method, the new array would become `["Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat"]`.

## An Array Unshift Method

An Unshift adds one or more items to the beginning of an array. For instance, if you had an array of `["Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP"]` you could use an unshift method to add `"Submarine"` and `"Float Plane"` to the beginning of the array to make it become `["Submarine", "Float Plane", "Canoe", "Kayak", "Row Boat", "Sail Boat", "SUP"]`.
