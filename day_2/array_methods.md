## pop

Takes the last element of an array and 'pops' it out. This popped element can be stored in a variable.


## push

Adds elements to the end of an array, can also return the amount of elements in an array.

## shift

This command mirrors the pop command, as it removes the first element (zero index) and returns this value.

## unshift

This command adds one or multiple items to an array. Items added will start at  the 0 index and be chained to the front, with old array data pushed to a higher index.
