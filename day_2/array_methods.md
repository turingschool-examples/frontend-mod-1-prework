pop(): The pop method removes the last element in a given array and returns it.

push(): Applying this method to a given array will add element(s) to the end of an array, and then return the new `length` of the array.

shift(): Shift removes the first element from an array and returns the new array.

unshift(): The unshift method is used to add element(s) to the front of an array and will return the new `length`.
