Today we are learning about array methods.

the .pop() method removes the last element of the array and returns that element
this changes the array.

the .push() method adds a new element to the end of an array and returns the new
length of the array.

the .shift() method removes the first element in the array and returns that
element. This changes the length of the array.

the .unshift() methods adds elements to the beginning of the array and returns
the new length of the array.
