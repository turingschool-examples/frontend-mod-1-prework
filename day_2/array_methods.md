## Methods to study
#### by Mike W. (he, him) FE

1. What is a pop  
  * Pop removes the last entry in an array list for example
  ```
      var housePets = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'lion'];
      console.log(housePets.pop()); //This will take lion out of the list
  ```

2. What is a push
  * The opposite of a pop this adds an item to the end of an array list
  ```
    var fastFoodOrder = ['burger', 'fries', 'softdrink'];
      fastFoodOrder.push('small nugget', 'milkshake');
      console.log(fastFoodOrder); // should add the small nugget & milkshake to the end of the array list
  ```

3. What is a unshift
  * Similar to to a push but it adds the item to the front of the array like

  ```
  var bookList = ['Lord of the Rings', 'Two Towers', 'Return of the King'];
  console.log(bookList.unshift('The Hobit'));
  console.log(bookList); //should add The Hobit to the beg
  ```
