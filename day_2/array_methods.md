    array methods
# `Quick Reference on Arrays`
An `array` is a special type of variable that stores a list of values.

Arrays are helpful when working with lists or a set of values that are equal
to each other.

Arrays are helpful when you don't know how many items will be on a list, as
you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.

CREATING AN ARRAY:
1. Arrays are named the same way as variables (var name)
2. Values are assigned in square brackets, each separated by a comma
3. Values within an array can include different data types
4. The above technique for creating an array is called an `array literal`
5. Array values can also be written on separate lines (not preferred); this
   technique is called an `array constructor`

`ARRAY LITERAL EXAMPLE`
var colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom']

`ARRAY CONSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE:`
var colors;
colors
var colors = new Array ('white',

                        'black',
                        
                        'custom')
