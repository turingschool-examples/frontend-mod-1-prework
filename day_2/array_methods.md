 1. Pop() - Use it to remove the last item on an Array.  

 2. Push(<item>) - adds <item> to the end of an Array.  

 3. Shift() - sort of like the inverse of Pop(), it removes the first item on an Array, and then subtracts 1 from the index of  each remaining item. 

 4. Unshift(<item>) -adds 1 to the index of each item in an Array and then adds <item> to the front  

All of these morph the array that calls it.
