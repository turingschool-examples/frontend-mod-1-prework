# Array Methods #  
## Pop ##  
   The pop method removes the last element in an array. It is written like this:
   `list.pop();`  

## Push ##  
   A push method adds a new element to the array at the end. It is written like this: `list.push('new item');`  

## Shift ##  
   Shift also removes and element from an array but unlike the pop method this removes the first element. It is written like this: `list.shift();`
## Unshift ##  
   Unshift allows you to add an element to the front of the array increasing its length. It is written like this: `list.unshift('new item');`
