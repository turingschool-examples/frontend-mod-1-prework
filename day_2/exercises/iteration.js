// example: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and print

var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {

// Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and prints "The
// <animal> is awesome!" for each animal.

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log("The " + animals[i] + " is awesome!");
}

// Create an array of foods and then iterate over that array to log "Add
// <food> to shopping list" for each food item.
let foods = ["Sushi", "Burritos", "Tacos"];
for (let i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
  console.log("Add " + foods[i] + " to shopping list");
}

// Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to log doubles
// of each of the number.
let numbers = [1,2,3,4];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  console.log(numbers[i]*2);
}
