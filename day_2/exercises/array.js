In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this

*/

// example: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 3 foods (strings)
let foods = ["Sushi", "Burritos", "Tacos"];

// example: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
console.log(animals[0]);

// Write code using bracket notation that will log the first item in the animals array
console.log(animals[0]);

// Write code using bracket notation that will log the last item in the animals array
console.log(animals[animals.length - 1])

// Write code using bracket notation that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.splice(animals.length -1, 1, "Gorilla");
console.log(animals);

// Write code below that will log the last item from the foods array.
console.log(foods[foods.length -1]);

// Write code below that uses a method to add "lion" to the animals array and
// log the changed array to verify "lion" has been added
animals.push("lion");
console.log(animals);

// Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the cahnged array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);
