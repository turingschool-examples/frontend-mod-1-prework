// Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
var first = animals[0];
console.log(first);

// Write code using bracket notation that will log the first item in the animals array
console.log(animals[0]);

// Write code using bracket notation that will log the last item in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

// Write code using bracket notation that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// Write code below that will log the last item from the foods array.
