// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar equal to thirdVar? (use the == operator)
console.log(firstVar == thirdVar); // this should return: true

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although thirdVar is a string and secondVar is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. Javascript forces the thirdVar into an integer to
perform this evaluation

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar strictly equal to thirdVar? (use the === operator)
console.log(firstVar === thirdVar); // this should return: false

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the firstVar is an integer value and the thirdVar is a string value, although they are both equal to 10,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar not equal to secondVar?

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar greater than or equal to 20?

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar greater than or equal to 21?
console.log(secondVar >= 21); // this should return: false

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar less than or equal to 20?
console.log(secondVar <= 20); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar less than or equal to 21?
console.log(secondVar <= 21); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is 0 equal to true?
console.log(0 == true) // this should return: false

// note: this is an example of a falsy value. In an evalution like this, 0 is considered to be false

// log the result of the comparison: is 1 equal to true?
console.log(1 == true) // this should return: true

// note: this is an example of a truthy value. In an evalution like this, 1 is considered to be true
