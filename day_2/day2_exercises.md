Lists and Links
1. Ordered lists are notated with <ol></ol> and are generally numbered; order matters. Unordered lists are notated with <ul></ul> and are generally bullet point lists; order does not matter as much with them. Definition lists are notated with <dl></dl> and are for sets of terms and definitions.
2. `<a href="URL">text</a>`
3. Include `target="_blank"`
4. First add an attribute to each section indicating what it is, e.g. `<h1 id="top">text</h1>`
Then when linking, `<a href="#top">top</a>`

CSS:
1. The purpose of CSS is to create rules for how each HTML element of a webpage should be presented.
2. Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading, in this context, means that if more than one rule applies to an element, one will take precedence. This can be because it is the latter, it is more specific, or it is marked with `!important`.
3. `selector {
              property: value;}`
4. You link an external stylesheet to your HTML with `<link href="PATH" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />`. The `href` should be the path to the CSS file.
5. An external stylesheet allows for all pages to follow the same rules easily and keeps the page content separate. It makes it easier to change things across the whole site.
6. Six-digit code that indicates the amount of red, green, and blue in a color. Preceded by a #.
7. HSL: hue, saturation, and lightness.
8. Serif (has serifs on the end of main strokes), sans-serif (does not have serifs), monospace (each letter has the same width).
9. Pixels, percentages, and ems.
