1. **Ordered**- Each item in the list is numbered and goes in order of 1, 2, 3, etc.

2. The basic structure for the link element is that first, there is the <a> tag identifying what kind of element will be used. Inside of the opening tag is the URL that you want to be linked to. After the opening tag is the text that will be clicked on to take you to that URL, followed by a closing </a> tag at the very end.

3. To open in a new tab, the attribute must include target=“_blank”

4. First, you need to identify the points in the page you want to link to. After that, you create the same element, but you add in a # followed by whatever you identified that part of the page as. So it would look like <a href=“#___”>

1. CSS is a way to individually style different elements on your webpage in a multitude of ways. You can style the text, background color, text boxes in all different shapes, colors, and styles.

2. CSS stands for ‘Cascading Style Sheet’. The meaning comes when a style rule applies in multiple ways, so your webpage will have to ‘cascade’ down to the most specific rule set to determine how to style certain objects.

3. There are 2 parts, a selector and a declaration. The selector is used to identify which element is being selected, and the declaration is used to outline the style that should be set.

4. You link a CSS stylesheet by using a <link> element, which tells the browser where to find the styling information.

5. When building a site with more than one page. This helps set the same style for all the pages in the document, instead of attaching the same style element internally to each element.

7. Hue, saturation, and lightness.

8. Serif (serif font has extra details on the ends of the letters), sans-serif (sans-serif has straight ends to letters), and monospace (every letter in monospace has the same width).

9. Pixels (most commonly used), percentages (compared to the default size of 16px) and EMS (which is equivalent to the width of a letter ‘m’).
