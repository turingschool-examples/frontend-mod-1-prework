5. **When is it useful to use external stylesheets as opposed to using interal CSS?**

It's useful to use an external stylesheet almost all of the time, outside of a rare instance in which you're creating a single webpage. The reason for this is that if you link to an external stylesheet you can use the same stylesheet on multiple webpages without having to paste the CSS code into each HTML title. Additionally, should you want to change your stylesheet, you can make changes to every page utilizing this stylesheet in one go rather than going back and changing them individually.
