**HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites**

1. Part 1

**There are three main types of lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. What are their differences?**

- `Ordered lists` using this type of list helps when you want each item on the list to be numbered. For example, a set of steps for a recipe that need to be performed in that particular order.

- `unordered lists` these list usually begin with a bullet point and have no particular order.

- `Definition lists` these usually create a set of definitions from a particular word, thus helping define it.

**What is the basic structure of an element used to link to another website?**

The basic structure of an element used to link another website would first start off with the `<a></a>` element.The structure usually starts with that and has href attribute followed by the the page of the link that it will take you to.

**What attribute should you include in a link to open a new tab when the link is clicked?**

The attribute you would include in a link to open a new tab would be the target attribute. The value of this attribute should be `_blank`

**How do you link to a specific part of the same page?**

How you link to specific part of the same page is by using the id attribute. this will help you identify the points in the page that the link will go to. The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore. Also, on a single page, no two id attributes can be the same.

2. Part 2

**What is the purpose of CSS?**

The purpose of CSS is to specify how the content of an element should appear. This helps you website look more attractive and helps with controlling the design of the website.

**What does CSS stand for? What does cascading mean in this case?**

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The Cascading means that styles can fall (cascade) from one style sheet to another, which enables multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.

**What is the basic structure of a CSS rule?**

The basic structure of a CSS rule is that it should always have a `selector` and a `declaration`. The selectors indicate which element that the rule will apply to. It can be applied to more than one element. The declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. They are split into a property and a value.

**How do you link a CSS stylesheet to your HTML document?**

How you link a CSS stylesheet to your HTML document is using the `<link>` by telling the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It's an empty element and it lives inside the `<head>` element.

**When is it useful to use external stylesheets as opposed to using internal CSS?**

It is useful to use these external stylesheets by using certain attributes. Some of them are `href` which specifies the path to the CSS file. `type` is an attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. `rel` specifies the relationship between the HTML and the page it is linked to.

**Describe what a color hex code is**

A color hex code is when hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code. Those three colors are the colors used to create every color on the screen.

**What are the three parts of an HSL color property?**

The three main parts of an HSL color property are going to be `Hue` which is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color. `Saturation` is the amount of gray in a color. It is also represented as a percentage. `lightness` is the amount of white or black in a color.

**In the world of typeface, what are the three main categories of fonts? What are the differences between them?**

The three main categories of fonts is Serif, which makes fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. Sans-serif, which have straight ends to letters, and therefore look a lot cleaner than Serif. Monospace is a font where the font is the same as the width. This font is commonly used for code.

**When specifying font-size, what are the main three units used?**

The three main units used on specifying font size are `pixels`, `percentages`, and `ems`. Pixels are the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended. Percentages changes the default size of your text. Ems allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element.
