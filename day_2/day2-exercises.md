<b>There are three main types of lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. What are their differences?</b>

Ordered lists are structured with numbers, letters, roman numerals, etc. (although style should be done with CSS), which are used for things that need to be ordered sequentially, while unordered lists are simply bullet points or dashes, which may be used for ingredients that don't need to be introduced in a specific order. Definition lists are used for lists of terms and their definitions.

<b>What is the basic structure of an element used to link to another website?</b>

An &lt;a&gt; tag is used with a href="" attribute. The content between the "" should be the URL for the page you want the link to access and between the beginning and ending &lt;a&gt; tags should be a description which will display on your webpage as a clickable link.

<b>What attribute should you include in a link to open a new tab when the link is clicked?</b>
