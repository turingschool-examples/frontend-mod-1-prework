1. **What is the purpose of CSS?**
	* CSS allows for specific control of content appearance. This is a quicker way of adding styling to each element with a specific tag instead of specifying the same appearance at each use of a specific tag. Great timesaver.

5. **When is it useful to use external stylesheets as opposed to using interal CSS?**
	* Larger websites with multiple pages can all link to the same css stylesheet, reducing loading times.
