#### CSS Questions

1. Purpose of CSS - it is to provide style to an HTML element.
2. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading means that CSS has certain rules that create an effect of prioritizing given the rules. For example: last rule tends to take precedent and more specific values will be prioritized.
3. CSS rule contains a selector and a declaration. Selector specifying the element being stylized and the declaration would be the specific style change being done.
4. Using <link> you can add the style instructions of a CSS sheet into any page using HTML.
5. It seems to benefit External stylesheets when you are writing a multi page website that can benefit from using the same guideline style rules.

6. Hex code is a 6 digit code that specifies the amount of red/green/blue in a color. They always start with a #.
7. HSL. H stands for hue which would be the specific color using degrees. S stands for saturation which measures the amount of grey in a specific color using percentage.

Sans-serif takes out these extra stylized edges and creates straight end to the letters, cleaner view overall. Monospace is a type that uses the same width for all letters creating a uniform width and helps letters align well which helps for things like coding. Easier to follow in general.
9. Font-size can be specified using PIXEL (px), PERCENTAGE (%), or EMS. Pixels start with a number and are followed by px. 16px being the default setting. Percentage uses this 16px default as a basis, but uses percentages to modify the amount. For example 50% would look like 8px. In EMS, em uses the width of the letter M to base the width of the letters.
