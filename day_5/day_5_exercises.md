#Chapter 2:  

1. To declare a variable, you must create the variable and give it a name. When you use the variable keyword, "var", the javascript interpreter knows that you are trying to create a variable. In order to use this variable, you must give it a name (an identifier). Once this variable has been created, you can tell it what type of information you would like it to store for you - once you have done this, you will be able to use this variable by name. The = sign in JavaScript is an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable.  
2. Three big data types:  
  1. Numeric: These handle numbers. These are used for tasks that involve counting or calculating sums. They can also be negative numbers or decimals.  
  2. Strings: Consists of letters and other characters. Must be enclosed in quotes. Can be used when working with any kind of text.  
  3. Booleans: These can have one of two values: true or false. Helpful in determining which part of a script should run.  
3. The six rules for naming variables are:  
  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It cannot start with a number.  
  2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or underscores. You cannot use a dash or period in the variable name.  
  3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. var is a keyword used to declare a variable.  
  4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.  
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.  
  6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word (camelCase).  
4. Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. To access items in an array, the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets. To change a value in an array, select the item and assign it a new value just as you would any other variable - using the equal sign and the new value for that item.  
5. Difference between an expression and a statement:  
  1. An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two types: expressions that just assign a value to a variable, and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.  
  2. A statement is each individual instruction or step in a script.  
6. Three types of operators:  
  1. Assignment operators: assign a value to a specific variable.  
  2. Arithmetic operators: perform basic math.  
  3. String operators: combine two strings with the + symbol.
