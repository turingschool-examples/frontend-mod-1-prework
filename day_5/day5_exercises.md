1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

To declare a variable, you use the keyword 'var'. This tells the browser to set the variable to a specific definition (string, integer, etc.). The equals sign acts as an assignment operator which assigns the definition (or value) to the variable.

2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans.
 Describe what each of them are.

Numbers- Numerical values (both positive and negative, and whole and decimal) used to either perform calculations or define sizes and measurements.

Strings- Text values enclosed within quotation marks.

Booleans- A data type that returns either a true or false value.

3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

- Variables cannot start with a number, it must either start with $, underscore, or letter.

- Within the name, it can contain letters, $, underscores, and numbers. It cannot contain a - or period.

- You cannot use reserved words or keywords, as these are already assigned to perform certain actions. If you do use this an error will occur as the browser is basically getting 2 differing forms of information.

- Variable names are case sensitive.

- The variable name should be relevant to what it is defining. For example, if you are setting a variable for the amount of eggs you have, then numOfEggs would be a good choice.

-Use camelCase format for variable names longer than one word. For example, numOfEggs where the first word within the word is lowercase, then all following words are uppercase.

4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

Arrays can simplify code by organizing similar values into one cohesive list. In order to change a value of an item within the array, you can select the item by using [] with the number within it of the item you are amending. For example, if your array contains: "chocolate", "vanilla", "strawberry"; and you would like to change the value of "strawberry" the code would look something like: var flavors[3] = "pistachio";

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

A statement acts as a step by step guide that a computer should follow when running a script, whereas an expression either performs a calculation to provide a value, or outright define a value. The main difference is that statements must run in chronological order, whereas a expression can be run in any order as long as the values are not inter-related.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

Assignment operator - Sets a variable to a defined value.

Arithmetic operator- Performs a basic math equation (ie 2 + 2)

String operator- Combines two or more sets of text values.
