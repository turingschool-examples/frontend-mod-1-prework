# Day 5 Exercises

### Chapter 2
1. You declare the variable by entering var ____ and then setting it equal (=) to whatever the value will be. The equal sign (=) is an assignment operator, which is showing that the value is being set to whatever the variable name is.

2. The number data type is simple a number, which can be a whole number or a number with a decimal point. A string is a sentence or a group or words or text. A Boolean is a data type that ends up having only 2 values, either true or false.

3. These are the 6 rules for naming a variable.
    1. The name must NOT start with a number. It can only start with a letter, dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_).
    2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_), but cannot contain a dash (-) or a period (.)
    3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words that already are used to tell your computer to do something.
    4. All variables are case sensitive, and it’s bad practice to name separate variables in a way like ‘happy’ and ‘Happy’.
    5. Use a name that describes the information that the variable stores
    6. If your variable has a name with more than 1 word, then use camelCase, or an underscore between words, but no dashes.

    Avoid using var, null, or if as they are part of the reserved words.

4. An array is helpful when you are unsure how many items you will end up with in a list. As long as they are all related items, like items on a shopping list, an array is the best way to add them into a list. To access or change a value, you must first know the index that is set to the value you want to change. Once you do that, you identify the index and then specify how you want it changed in separate lines of code that follow your array.

5. An expression is a created value, while a statement is the directions to perform a specific action.

6. Arithmetic operators are your basic mathematical functions. A string operator can combine multiple separate variables, like adding a name variable with a greeting variable to create a greetings string. Comparison operators compare values and return a boolean true or false based on the outcome.
