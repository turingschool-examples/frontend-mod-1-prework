Chapter 2

1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

  * In order to declare a variable, it first must be announced that it will be used. This is done by creating the variable and giving it a name. The equal sign says that you are going to assign it a value to the variable. In JavaScript the equal sign is called an **assignment operator**.

2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

 * Numeric data types are types that handle numbers. Best when you have tasks that involve counting or calculating sums. The numbers can be positive, negative, or a decimal.

 * String data types consist of letters and other characters. Strings are used when working on text. They are frequently used to add new content into a page and can contain HTML markup.


 * Boolean data types can only have one of two values: true and false. They are helpful determining which part of a script should run.  

3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

  * The six rules for naming a JavaScript are:
    1. Must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. And cannot start with a number.
    2. Can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. Cannot use a dash or a period.
    3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
    4. All variables are case sensitive.
    5. Use names that describe the kind of information that the variable stores.
    6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use camel case or a underscore. Never a dash.

  * Here are a few reserved words that should be avoided:
    * Array
    * home
    * outerHeight
    * valueOf
    * Object

4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

 * Arrays are useful when you don't know how many items a list will contain. It helps because you don't need to specify how many values it will hold.

 * Values in an array are accessed by specifying the index number for that value inside square brackets. You can change the value by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable.

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

  * An expression evaluates into a single value. They rely on operators, which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
  * Statements are individual instructions that the computer will follow. Each statement starts on a new line and always ends with a semicolon.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

  * Three types of operators are: Arithmetic Operators, String Operators, and Logical Operators.
    * Arithmetic Operator is JavaScript that uses mathematical operators such as +, /, * , ++, %.
    * String Operator only uses one string operator: the + symbol. it is used to join strings on either side of it.
    * Logical Operator allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. Both the Logical and Operator look to see if both expressions on either side of it return true or false.
