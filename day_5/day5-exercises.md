1.  How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

    To declare a variable you need to use the variable keyword 'var' and give that a name such as quantity. The equals sign is assigning a value to the variable that can also be used to update that variable later. It is called an assignment operator.

2.  There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

    Numbers: These are what you'd expect 0-9 and no commas are used. 0.75 is acceptable as is 7487. These can be used for calculations, but also for placement and timing of different elements.

    Strings: Are letters and other characters and must be passed with match quotes, single or double are fine as long as they match. Strings are useful for adding content to pages and can also include HTML markup.

    Booleans: These can either have a value of true or false and are useful when determining which part of a script should run. These are either true of false and can be thought of like a light switch.

3.  What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

    A. A name must start with a $, _ or a letter. It cannot start with a number.

    B. A name contain letters, numbers, $ or an underscore. This cannot include a - or a . in a variable name.

    C.You cannot use keywords or reserved words that are used by the JavaScript interpreter.

    D. All variables are case sensitive so estelle and Estelle would be two separate variables. It is bad practice to have the same name using different cases.

    E. A good name is one that describes the kind of information that it stores. firstName and lastName are descriptive of the variable.

    F. If your variable name is more than one word long it should be declared in camelCase, or with an underscore separating them. No dashes.

    Some reserved JavaScript words are:

    package, long, import, new, static, void and goto.

4.  How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

    An array is a great option for a list containing multiple values that may change like a grocery shopping list. You don't have define how many values are in an array so it's flexible.

    Values in an array are automatically given an index number that starts with 0 not 1. You can change a value in an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value.

5.  What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

    An expression results in a single value and can be used to perform operations as well. The statements we are familiar with are declaring a variable and not performing an operation.

6.  What are three types of operators and how are they used?

    The string operator is used to combine two strings.
    The comparison operator compares two values and returns true or false.
    Logical operators combine expressions and return a boolean value.

    //The smooth operator coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male. Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.
