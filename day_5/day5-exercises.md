<h1>Day 5</h1>
<h2>1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>You declare a variable by using a variable keyword (var, const, let) and the variable name. For example, var = score. The equal sign is the Assignment Operator and is used to assign a value to the variable. You can also use it to update the value of a given variable. The variable essentially stores the value given to it.</p>
<h2> 2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</h2>
<p>Numbers are any number, positive or negative, as well as any fraction or decimal. Examples of numbers: 5, 21780, -51, .75, .423. Strings are made up of letters and other characters. String examples: ‘My name is Dave’, ‘Low’, ‘There is an Error!!!’. Boolean data is either true or false, on or off. Boolean examples: true, false.</p>
<h2>3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?</h2>
The name must begin with a letter, $ sign or _ score. It cannot start with a number.
The name can contain letters, numbers $ signs or underscores. It cannot contain a dash(-) or period.
You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
All variables are case sensitive. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
You should use a name that describes the kind of information the variable stores.
You should use camelCase for variables that contain more than one word. For example, firstName and lastName.
Some JavaScript reserved words: class, else, return, this, true, false, const, var.
<h2> 4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?</h2>
<p>Arrays can be useful as you do not need to know how many items a list will contain when you first create it. Instead of creating enough variables for a long list you can use an array and update it. You access a value in an array with the name of the array followed by the index number in brackets. For example, var firstNames = [‘Lisa’, ‘Mel’, ‘Burt’]. The indexes for each are Lisa-0, Mel-1, Burt-2. You would access Mel with, firstNames[1]. If you wanted to change the value of Mel you would access it and assign it a new value. For example, firstNames[1] = ‘Malorie’.</p>
<h2>5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</h2>
<p>A statement is an instruction or step that a computer can follow. Statement example: console.log(‘Hello’). An expression evaluates into a single value. An expression can use two or more values and return a single value. Expression example, var volume = 10 * 54 * 32.</p>
<h2>6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?</h2>
<p>Assignment Operators: used to assign a value to a variable. Ex: lastName = ‘Mahmoud’
Arithmetic Operators: used to perform basic math. Ex: classSize = 160 / 12;
String Operators: used to combine two strings. Ex: favoriteColor = “My favorite color is ‘ + ‘green’;</p>
