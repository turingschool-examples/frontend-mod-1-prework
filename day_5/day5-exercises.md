## Chapter 2
1. You declare a variable by using the keyword var, and in order to use the variable you have to give it a name, which is called an identifier. The equals sign means that you are assigning a value to the variable. It is called the assignment operator in JavaScript.
2. The numeric data type handles numbers. The numbers do not use commas, and you may use negative numbers and decimals as well. The string data type consists of both letters and other characters. It is always enclosed within a pair of quotes (either double or single quotes). Boolean data types can either have a true or a false value.
3. The six rules for naming variables are:

The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an underscore, but never a number.

The name can contain letters, numbers, a dollar sign, or an underscore, but not a dash or a period. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are words that tell the interpreter to do something (ex. var is used to declare a variable). Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. A few examples of reserved words are boolean, final, function, return, default, and break.

All variables are case sensitive, and it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable will store.

If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, firstMeal instead of firstmeal.

4. Arrays are helpful when dealing with multiple related values because you may not know how many items a list will contain, and you do not have to specify how many values you will have with an array. To access a value from an array, after the array name you would specify the index number for that value inside of the square brackets. You can change the value of an item in an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value the way you would with any other value, using the equals sign.
5. An expression evaluates into a single value. There are two types of expressions: Expressions that assign a value to a variable and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. A statement is an individual instruction or step that is part of a series of instructions (script) that the computer can follow.
6. An assignment operator will assign a value to a variable. An arithmetic operator will perform a basic math equation. A string operator will combine two strings into one value.
