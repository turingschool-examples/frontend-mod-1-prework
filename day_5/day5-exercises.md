<h2>Chapter 2 (Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays)</h2>

<h3>How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?</h3>
<i>The variable is declared by using a var "keyword". After the variable is declared and given a name you need to assign it a value. This is done via an assignment operator ( the equals sign ).</i>  


<h3>There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</h3>

<i><ul>
    <li><b>Numeric</b> - Just as it sounds. This data type handles numbers. Especially numbers that might be involved in mathematical calculations.
    <li><b>String</b> - This of this as a "content" data type. It consists of letters and other characters. Note that string data type is always placed in quotes (single or double). Also note that you can use HTML markup on the <b>string</b> data type.
    <li><b>Boolean</b>- More abstract but very useful. It carries two possible values: true or false. This is helpful when determining what part of a script should run. </i>
    </ul>

<h2>What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?</h2>

<i><ul>
<li><b>Rule 1</b>- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an underscore. Never with a number.
<li><b>Rule 2</b>- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or an underscore. You can not use a dash or a period in a variable name.
<li><b>Rule 3</b>- You can't use keywords or reserved words.
<li><b>Rule 4</b>- All variables are case sensitive.
<li><b>Rule 5</b>- Use name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
<li><b>Rule 6</b>- Use camel case if variable has more than one word. EX: firstName.
</ul>

A few JS reserved words are: else, debugger, for, function, catch, new, true.

<h2>How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?</h2>
<i> Its useful when creating list with an unknown number of items because when creating an array you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. After you create an array you can change one of the item in the array by calling its index ( first item starts with a 0). So if your array is var colors = ['white', 'black', 'green']; and you need to change green to red you would do the following  colors[2] = 'red';</i>

<h2>What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</h2>
  <i> Expression is a unit of code that resolves to a value, ex: color x = 2;. A statement is an instruction to do something that will eventually result to a value. Its like a recipe</i>


<h2>What are three types of operators and how are they used?</h3>

<i>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Assignment Operator</b>- This operator assigns a value to a variable. its expressed using an equals sign (=).
 <li><b>Arithmetic Operators</b>- These operators perform basic mathematics. Multiplication, addition devision etc.
 <li><b>String Operators</b>- This operator combines two strings.
 <ul>
