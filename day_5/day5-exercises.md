#### Chapter 2 (Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays) questions;

1. You declare a variable by starting with the `var`, this is a  variable keyword and following with a variable name. You just declared the variable by giving it a name. The equal sign means you are assigning the value to the variable. It is called the assignment operator and can be used to update the value of the variable.

2. The number data types are numbers or negative numbers that are used for tasks involving counting or calculating the total. They can also be used to determine the size of a screen, moving the position of an element, or setting how long an item fades in. String data types are letters and characters enclosed in "quotes" (straight not curly). Strings are used to contain any kind of text, whether it be phone numbers or a school name, and are used to add new content to any page. Booleans are used to give the variable the value of either true or false. This is helpful determining which path the script might take.

3. The six rules for naming a variable are as follows; first rule; the name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. Second rule; the name can contain letters, numbers, a dollar sign, or an underscore, but cannot use a dash or a period. Third rule; you cannot use keywords or reserved words, such as var, to name a variable. Fourth rule; when naming a variable remember they are case sensitive. This means if you are naming a variable "numbers", you have to repeat with all lowercase letters to get the same result. Fifth rule; the name must describe the information that the variable stores. For example the name can be stoneFruit. That will mean that the variable will store only peaches, nectarines, etc. Sixth rule; always use camelcase when naming a variable. This means the first word must be lowercase and the words after that (only the first letter) must be capitalized. Also, A few reserved words that you should avoid using when naming variables are var, class, delete, void, function. etc.

4. An array can be useful when dealing with multiple related values because it is designed to store lists of values that are related to each other. A good example is a to do list. You can change/access a value in an array by after the array variable name has been specified you then take the index number of the array value inside square brackets and then use a string and make it the value of the new value. Example; `var numbers = ["1", "2", "3"]` and if you want to change the number 3 to a different value you will write `numbers [2] = "4";`.

5. The difference between an expression and a statement is; an expression results into a single value whether it be assigning a value to a variable or using two or more values to get to a single value and a statement does something. A statement uses the values made by the expressions to give an action or command to that variable.

6. The three types of operators are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and string operators. Assignment operators `(=)` are used to assign a value to a variable, Arithmetic operators `(*)` are used to perform math, and String operators `(+)` are used to combine two strings.
