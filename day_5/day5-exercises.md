# Day 5:

## Chapter 2 questions:

### How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
You declare a variable by using a keyword (like var) and give it a name. Ex: "var quantity" the name quality is what has been declared for var. The equal sign in JavaScript is called an assignment operator. It tells the computer that you're about to assign a value to the variable. Ex: quantity = 4.


### There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
The numeric data type is any data that involves numbers. It's used for tasks that need to count or calculate something, but it can also be used for determining size of the screen, or positioning an element. The string data type is enclosed within quotes (single or double). Strings will add new text content to the page. Strings can even contain html markup. Booleans help determine what part of script to run, they are either true or false and act on the page according to what assignment is given.


### What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
    * 1st rule: The variable name cannot start with a number, it has to be a letter or $ sign.
    * 2nd rule: The name should not contain a period . or a dash - only letters, numbers, $ or _
    * 3rd rule: Keywords like var, and reserved words should not be used.
    * 4th rule: since variables are case sensitive you want it to match. So it I used the word quantity, it would be bad practice to type Quantity somewhere else.
    * 5th rule: Use a variable that is easy to tell what kind of information is being stored, something descriptive.
    * 6th rule: Use camelCase for the variable name (underscores can also be used but it's better to be consistent with one)


### How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
  An array is helpful when you are creating a list and you may not know how many items will be on that list yet, since you don't need to specify how many values there are. The values should however, be related to each other. This can save a lot of time when you don't have to create variables for each item. You can later access a value in an array and make changes to it by taking the original value name specifying that value to be changed and reassigning it a new value with the = sign.

### What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Statements are a set of instructions for the computer to follow. If (this), then (that) would be the general line of thinking for a statement. An expression evaluates into a single value. Even if two values are entered in, it returns a single value.

### What are three types of operators and how are they used?
1. An assignment operator is the equal sign, it assigns a value to an variable.
2. An arithmetric operator will perform basic math like multiplication for the return of a single value of the equation.
3. String operators will combine two strings together into a single string value.
