1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

  You declare a variable by writing a variable keyword such as `var` `const` or `let` followed by a variable name in camel case. For example, `var variableName`.

  When assigning a variable you use the "assignment operator" or equal sign after the variable name to assign it a value.

1. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

  Numbers can be integers, floats or negative numbers.

  Strings contain any combination of letters and characters and can also be used to interpolate other statements. They are wrapped in single or double quotes.

  Boolean Data has a value of either true or false. This is a a binary function, which is like a light switch either on or off.

1. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

  1. The name must start with a letter, "$" or " _ ".
  1. Name can contain the above characters, but must not use a dash or period in a variable name.
  1. You cannot use keywords or reserved word within JS. For example, var, let or const.
  1. Do not create variables of the same name using different cases.
  1. Use a name that describes the kind of data that is stored in the variable.
  1. Use camelCase or a (-) to separate words in the name.


4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

  Arrays can be useful when dealing with multiple related values because it can prevent you have to do extra work in declaring many variables. Instead store them in array, which you will be able to access, view and change easily at will.

  You can access a value in array by cite the array name and then specify the index number of the value you would like to access. For example, `array[0]`. To change the value, you can treat it like any other variable and assigning a new value such as the following `array[0] = "New Value"`.

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

  Statements are individual instructions that the program should follow. Expressions are statements that evaluate into a single value.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

  Assignment Operators - used to assign a value to a variable.

  Arithmetic Operators - used to perform math.

  String Operators - used to combine two strings.
