1.  How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
To declare a variable you use the 'var' keyword to let javascript know that you are about to assign a word as a variable. The = represents the assignment operator.

2.  There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
Numbers- integers that can be calculated manipulated or used in calculation
Strings- A string is a set of data that typically will not be changed or manipulated directly such as a phone number, names, product names or simple messages to the user.
Booleans- A Boolean is a strict binary yes or no question such as is the glass full or is the tank at capacity.

3.  What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
 3.1. Variable must begin with a letter or underscore
 3.2. Never use a dash or periods in your variable names
 3.3. Never use Javascript reserved words such as: break, delete, default, continue, else, finally, function
 3.4. Javascript is case sensitive. You should not create two variables with the same name and different casing
 3.5. Use variable names that describe the content they are holding ex: firstName would be a better variable name for a persons first name than penguinHolder
 3.6. If variable names are more than one word use camelCasing in order to show the break in words without using spaces or dashes.

4.  How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
An Array is good when you dont know how many items a list of related subjects will end up containing. This allows you to assign a var name to your items even if the list will continue to grow or shrink down the line. The item() command allows you to pick out a specific item out of your array either for calculation or to present to the user. To access or change a value in an array you can do this by selecting the var name followed by the coordinate of the item you want to change in [] then use the = to then assign it to a new value or name.

5.  What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
An expression resolves one or more elements into a single value. A statement is a "if, than, for" type of statement that has static values attached.

6.  What are three types of operators and how are they used?
  6.1. Arithmetic operator- This is used to make calculations with numbers and floats. This operator uses the rule of PEMDAS when making calculations.
  6.2. String operator- This is used to combine strings. This is done using the + which allows you to do things like firstName + lastName;
  6.3. Assignment operator-  The assignment operator is the = it is used to assign names to variables and values to variables.
