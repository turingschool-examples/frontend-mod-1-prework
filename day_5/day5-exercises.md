1. to declare a variable you have to let the computer know by entering the keyword "var". then you can give the variable its name. The equals sign is what is known as an 'assignment operator' its job is to assign the variable value to the variable name.
2. numbers are used in calculations, dont use decimals when using numbers. Strings are in quotes, the quotes have to be the same style. Booleans are true/false, these are helpful when determining which parts of a script should run.
3. One: The variable name has to start with a letter, dollar sign or a underscore, never a number. Two: The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. you cant use a dash- or a period. Three: you cant use keywords like var, you also cant use reserved words because one day they might turn into keywords. Four. Its case sensitive so be consistant and careful. Five. use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. Six: if the variable is made up of more than one word you can use camelcase or underscores, no dashes. Reserved words include, catch, void, static and protected.
4. Arrays are useful because they can hold multiple values. A value in an array can be accessed by specifying the array and adding square brackets that hold the index number, to change the value put a equals sign after the brackets and enter the new value.
5. An expression gives you a single value for a variable, wether it was assigned that way or the result of a calculation. A statement is an individual step or instruction that can sometimes be a part of a script.
6. Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. Arithmetic operators perform basic math. String operators combine two strings.
