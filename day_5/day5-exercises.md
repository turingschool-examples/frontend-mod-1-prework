### How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
* You declare a variable (var) by giving it a name, or identifier. If variable name is more than one word, use camelCase.
* The equal sign is an assignment operator. It is the the value to the variable.

### There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
* Numbers: for tasks that involve counting or calculating sums.
* Strings: Letters and other characters, typically used for text.
* Booleans: A light switch--uses true or false. Determines which part of a script should run.

### What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
1. Name can never start with a number. Use dollar sign, letter, or underscore.
2. Do not use a dash or period in the name. Instead use letters, numbers, dollar sign, and underscore.
3. Do not use keywords or reserved words.
4. All variables are case sensitive. Don't use same names with different cases.
5. Use a descriptive name for the stored information.
6. Use camelCase for every word after the first word. You can also use an underscore.

### How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
* They're useful when you don't know how many items a list will contain because you don't need to specify how many values it
will hold. They can also hold different types of variables.
* Access: After the array name, specify index number for that value inside the square brackets.
* Change: select an item and assign it a new value like you would any other variable.

### What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
