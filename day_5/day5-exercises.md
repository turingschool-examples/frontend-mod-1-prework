1.  How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

You declare a variable using VAR (variable keyword) before the variable name and then set that equal to the variable value. The equal sign after the variable name would be the assignment operator and is used to assign or update a value to a variable.

2.  There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

Numeric data types (or numbers) are used for calculation and can be whole numbers, negatives, or even decimals.
Strings are typically used for content and are denoted by two quotation marks. Between the quotations will lie the content that is typically used for content on pages.
Booleans are either one of two values: true or false. They are used to tell the code what to do in certain instances (if something is true - do this, if false - do that).

3.  What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

1: The name cannot start with a number, but only a dollar sign, letter, or an underscore.
2: The name however can contain all of the above, ($, numbers, letters, underscores) but not a dash or a period.
3: Do not used reserved words (see below).
4: All variables are case sensitive.
5: Use a descriptive name that accurately describes the information in the variable.
6: Use camel case when using multiple words. Camel case is to use a captial letter for the first letter of each word after the first word.

Reserved words: var, with, else, if, in, while are just a few of the many reserved words that JavaScript has.

4.  How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

Arrays are useful because you don't need to specify how many values they will contain. So when dealing with multiple values, you can always add more. You can actually even use code to update the values that are in an array.

5.  What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

An expression results in a single value while a statement is more like instructions or steps that the code needs to take.

6.  What are three types of operators and how are they used?

Three types of operators are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and string operators. Assignment operators do just that: assign a value to a variable. Arithmetic operators do computations (addition, multiplication, subtraction and so on) and string operators combine multiple strings.
