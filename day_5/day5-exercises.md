1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?<br />
<p>var quantity = value  equal sign means that you are going to assign a value to the variable  and it is called the  <b>assignment operator</b> </p>
2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.<br />
<p>Numbers: are obviously numbers they can be positive negative or decimal <br />
Strings: closed with in "" contain data types that consist of letter and other characters<br />
Booleans: are true or false data types</p>
3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?<br />
<p>A.The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or and underscore it must not start with  a number.<br />
B.The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or underscore, but no dash or periods. <br />
C.you cannot use keywords or reserved words which tell the interpreter what to do like nameing a var var. as well as words that might become keywords in future versions of java<br />
D.variables are case sensitive so Car and car would be diffrent vars but bad idea<br />
E.use names that describe the information stored in the var so dont use var age for a users last name its just dumb<br />
F.when creating a name that is multiple words use a lower case letter for the first letter of the first word then an uppercase letter for every subsequent word. ex carMake<br />
Some key words include if, then, var, class, and do.</p>
4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?<br />
<p>An array is most useful when you do not know how many items  a list will contain because when you create an array you do not need to specify how many values it will hold and then you can access the array instead of creating a var for each individual item.<br />
When accessing an array it is important to remember that the position of an item in the array starts at 0 so if you have 4 items in a list the items will be 0-3.  So to access the array all you would have to type in is the name of the array because it's your variable and then in [] the list number of the item you would like to retrieve. Using the same method you can change in array by typing in the name of your array then in [] the position that you would like to change then use the = to assign its new value. EX:<br />
var cars = [Mustang, f-150, McLaren P1, Ford GT]<br />
cars[3] would be the Ford GT<br />
to change the array
cars[1] = Lamborghini Huracán Evo would change the value of f-150 to Lamborghini Huracán Evo</p>
5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?<br />
<p>Statements are the steps and expressions are what the steps do when they return into a single value Ex:<br />
Var color = red<br />
Var math = 3 + 1<br />
Both of are statements but the expressions of the statements is that color is set to red and that math equals four</p>
6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?<br />
<p>Assignment operator, arrhythmic operator, and string operator. <br />
The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable like var firstName= Kyle <br />
The arrhythmic operator performs basic math like 3×2<br />
The string operator combines two strings like var greeting = “Hi “ + firstName;</p>
