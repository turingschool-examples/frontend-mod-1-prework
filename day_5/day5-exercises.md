<p><b>How do you declare a variable? What does the equals sign really mean in Javascript? What is it called in Javascript? </p></b>

<p> You declare a variable using the variable keyword and giving the variable a name, also known as an identifier. The equals sign in Javascript is called an assignment operator, and it means you are updating/assigning the value given to a variable. </p>

<p><b>There are three big data types in Javascript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are. </p></b>

<p> Numbers are fairly self explanatory - they are numeric data types either in full digit or decimal format, and they can be negative or positive. String data types consist of letter and other characters like punctuation. They are enclosed in quotation marks. Booleans are true/false values and can be helpful when determining which part of a script to run. </p>

<p><b>What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few Javascript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names? </p></b>

<p> 1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore - absolutely no numbers.</p>
<p> 2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or and underscore. No dashes or periods. </p>
<p> 3. No using keywords or reserved words. These are used to tell the computer to do something and shouldn't be used in a name. </p>
<p> 4. Do not create two variables with the same name but different cases, like name and Name. </p>
<p> 5. Let the name clearly reflect the kind of information the variable represents, like streetAddress. </p>
<p> 6. Use camel case if the variable name is comprised of multiple words. This means uppercasing the first letter of each word after the first word. You can also use an underscore instead of camel case. </p>

<p><b>How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array? </p></b>

<p> Arrays can be useful when using multiple related values because you don't need to know how many items will be contained within the list when you create it with an array. To access a value from the array, you specify the index number for the value inside square brackets. To change the value, you can just select it and assign it a new value.</p>

<p><b>What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</p></b>
<p> An expression relates specifically to a variable with a single value. It can either assign a value to a variable or use 2+ values to return a single value. Statements are individual instructions or a single step for the computer to follow. A group of these statements creates a script. </p>

<p><b> What are three types of operators and how are they used? </p></b>
<p> Three types of operators are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and string operators. Assignment ones are used to assign a value to a variable. Arithmetic operators perform basic math. String operators are used to combine two strings into one. </p>
