1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

You declare a variable by starting with a keyword that javascript knows is used to create a variable like "var" then you must give the variable a name. ex. var quantity;

The equal sign is an assignment operator. It says that you are about to assign a value to the variable.

2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

The numeric data type handles numbers. Used for tasks that involve calculating sums but also used for tasks such as determining size of screen, moving the position of elements, or setting the amount of time an element should take to fade in or out.

The string data type consists of letters and other characters. It is always enclosed in single or double quotes. Strings can be used when working with any kind of text.

The boolean data type can only have a value of true or false. Helpful when determining which part of a script should run.


3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. CANNOT start with a number.
  2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. Must not use a dash or a period in a variable name.
  3. You CANNOT use keywords or reserved words. Examples: byte, float, false, long, short, return, var, void.
  4. All variables are case sensitive, so turing and Turing would be different variable names. However it is not good practice to use same name variables with different cases.
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. Ex. firstName to store a persons first name and lastName to store their last name.
  6. If a variable had multiple words, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first. ex. firstName rather than firstname.

4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

You can store multiple variables all in one array, rather than creating a long list of variables. You can access/change a value in an array by specifying the index number for that value inside brackets. ex. colors[2] = 'purple';

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

Expressions assign a value to a variable or use two or more values to return a single value.
Statements perform actions but don't resolve values.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. ex. color = 'black';
Arithmetic operators perform basic math. ex. area = 7 * 4;
String operators combine two strings. ex. goodbye = 'See ya ' + 'Caleb';
