# Chapter 2 questions

## 1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

 To declare a variable, you start by assigning it a name; if it is more than one word, you use camelCase. you need the variable keyword (var), followed by the variable name. After you have declared the variable, you can give it information. The variable name is followed by an equals sign, which means assignment operator in JavaScript. The equals sign says that you are assigning a value to the variable, and is also used to update the value given to the variable.

## 2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

  Number: This is used when for tasks that involve calculating a sum or counting. It can be a whole number (no comma needed for numbers that are 1000 plus), negative numbers, and decimals. They can also be used for tasks such as determining the size of an object. Numbers are not written inside of quotation marks.

  Strings: Strings data type contain letters and other characters. It is enclosed with in quotes, either single or double, but the quotes have to match. Strings are used when working with any type of text. They must also always be written on one line.

  Booleans: Booleans have only two values: true or false. It is helpful to use Boolean data type like an on or off switch, either the statement is true, or it is false.

## 3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

  The 6 rules:
    1. The names has to start with a letter, a dollar sign, or an under score. It cannot start with a number.
    2. It can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but it must not contain a dash or period in the variable name.
    3. The variable cannot use keywords or reserved words, such as var.
    4. Every variable is case sensitive, so Dog and dog would be two different variables, but it is not recommended to have two variables written like that.
    5. Variables need names that describe the kind of information it stores.
    6. Variables must be written in camelCase if using more than one word. That means the the first word is lower case and every word following starts with a capital letter. For example iLovePuppies.


## 4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

  Arrays are  useful when working with a list of related values, you do not need to know how many values are in the array. You can change a value of an item in the array by selecting it and assigning it a new value, by using the equal sign. You can also use a loop to help if you do not want to rewrite out all of the array.

## 5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

  Expression: This results in a single value. There are two types of an expression: expressions that just assign a value to a variable (such as assigning a color to the variable), and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value (such as performing operations on numbers to get a single value, or when the expression uses two values to get a single value meaning it started with two strings and yields one string).

  Statement: A statement is an action or an instruction, for example 'if...else', 'empty', 'continue'.

## 6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

  Assignment operators: Assigns a value to the variable, for example: color = 'blue'; would make the variable blue.

  Arithmetic operators: This performs basic math such as adding, subtracting, division, multiplication, increments, decrements, and modulus. It does this in order of operations, it will multiply and divid before it adds or subtracts. This may be used when totaling the cost of an item and adding the appropriate tax to it.

  String operators: This combines two strings, the plus '+' symbol. It can be used when you need to join two or more strings together to create one single value or one new string called concatenation. You can also use numbers as a string when wanting more data for your final value.
