## 1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

To declare a variable, you need to state a variable keyword (var, const, or let) followed by a variable name, an assignment operator, and the value of the variable.

The equals sign is treated as an assignment operator in JavaScript, and is used to assign or update a value to a variable.

## 2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

Numbers or floats are numerical values.

Strings are character values. Numbers inside a string will not be treated as number data types.

Booleans are true/false values.

## 3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

- Names must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore. Names must not start with a number.
- Names can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or underscores. You cannot use dashes or periods in variable names.
- You cannot use keywords or reserve words.
- All variables are case-sensitive. It is bad practice to have variants of the same name.
- You should use names that describe the type of information the variable stores.
- Use camel case for variable names that are made up of more than one word.


## 4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

Arrays are useful for when you're not sure how many items will be in a list, because you can specify an array and modify the values inside of it over time.

To access values in an array, you can call on an array and specify the needed items' index value.

## 5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

Expressions use two or more values to return a single value. A statement assigns a single value to a signle variable.

## 6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

Addition operator (+) adds one value to another.
Subtraction operator (-) subtracts one value from another.
Increment operator (++) adds one to a value.
