**JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development**

**How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?**

How you declare a variable is by giving it a name, which will be called variable name. What the equal sign really means is that you are going to assign a value to the variable. It is also used to update the value given to a variable. The equal sign is called the assignment operator.   

**There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.**

- `numbers` the numeric data type handles numbers. They are used for tasks that involve calculating sums. They are also used for tasks such as determining the size of the screen, moving the position of an element on a page as well as setting the amount of time an element should take to fade in. It's good to know that numbers are not written inside quotation marks.

- `strings` the string data type consists of letters and other characters, as well as numeric data that will stay constant. Strings can be used when working with any kind of text, such as adding new content into a page and they can contain HTML markup.

- `booleans` the boolean data type consists of having only two values, true and false. It's helpful to think of it as a light switch, on or off or 0/1. Booleans can also be used when your code can take more than one path. It is a great data type for making decisions.   

**What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?**

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign `$`, or an underscore `_`. It cannot start with a number.

2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign `$` or an underscore `_`. You cannot use a dash or a period.

3. You cannot use *keywords* or *reserved* words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. for example, var is a keyword to declare a variable. Reserved words are words that may be used in future JavaScript applications.

4. All variables are case sensitive.

5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, `myDog` might be used for the name of your dog. Or `firstName` will be used to represent their first name.

6. Use camel case, for example, camelCase instead of camelcase. Or bestFoodOfAllTime instead of bestfoodofalltime.   

**How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?**

How an array can be useful when dealing with multiple related values is when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create an array, you don't have to specify how many values it will hold which is very useful. How you change a value in a array is by selecting it and assigning it to a new value just as you would any other variable. 

**What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**

The difference between an expression and a statement is an expression will produce a value and can be written wherever a rule is expected. An expression evaluates into a single value. A statement on the other hand is a standalone unit of execution and does not return anything.

**What are three types of operators and how are they used?**

1. *Assignment Operators* Assign a value to a variable. Example `color = 'beige';` so now the the value of the color is beige.

2. *Arithmetic Operators* These will perform basic math. Example `area = 5*5;` so now the value of area is now 25.

3. *String Operators* These will combine two strings. Example `greeting = 'Hi' + 'Derek';` so now the value of greeting is now Hi Derek.
