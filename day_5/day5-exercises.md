Chapter 2 Reading Questions:
1. You declare a variable by writing var variableName = whatever the variable is. The = is called the assignment operator and its function is to assign values to variables, or to reassign values.
2. Numbers are exactly that. They are numeral values that can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (decimals). Strings are like text. They are written in quotes and can include letters, numerals, and punctuation. Booleans are valued `true` or `false` and function kind of like a switch.
3. 1 - they must begin with a letter, underscore, or $. 2 - They can contain letters, numbers, $ or underscores. They cannot contain - or periods. 3 - You cannot use keywords or reserved words. 4 - Variables are case-sensitive. 5 - Use descriptive naming for variables. 6 - If it is made up of more than one word, use camel case.
A few reserved words are: break, protected, and long.
4. Arrays are useful for dealing with multiple related values because they put them in what is essentially a list. You can access a value in an array with
`var = itemAccessing;
itemAccessing = thisIsAnArray[3];`
You can change a value in an array with
`thisIsAnArray[3] = 'new string'`
5. The difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression evaluates a value, while a statement is an individual instruction.
6. Three types of operators:
 - `++` adds one to the current number
 - `-` subracts one value from another
 - `%` divides two values and returns the remainder
