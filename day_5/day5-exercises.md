1.  **How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?**
  Declaring a variable is done by typing `var` followed by what you'd like the variable to be called. It is written as one word in camelCase. An equals sign is called an Assignment Operator. When you use it, you are saying that you would like to state what the value of a variable is. Each time you use it, it updates the variable to the new value.
2.  **There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.**
  Numbers are just data with numerical value, e.g. 3, -4556, 3.556.
  Strings are data that use letters and characters and are always enclosed in quotes, e.g. "jump" , "Panic" , "A"
  Booleans are data types that can have a value of true or false.
3.  **What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?**
  * variable names mustn't begin with a number, only a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
  * variables mustn't use dashes or periods
  * you cannot use keywords or reserved words
  * variables are case sensitive, and it is bad practice to have 2 different variables of the same name and different cases
  * names should be descriptive of what type of data they contain
  * use camelCase if variable names are more than one word.

  Some words you shouldn't use as variable names include: true, false, var, catch, if, for, else
4.  **How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?**
  Instead of creating a long list of variables for related values, you can create an array. You also don't need to specify how many items the array will be.
  To change a value in an array, call the array name followed by the index number, then use an Assignment Operator to redefine it to a new value. e.g. `names[3] = "John"`
5.  **What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**
  An expression is a line of code resulting in a value.
  A statement is an action or an instruction that doesn't result in a value.
6.  **What are three types of operators and how are they used?**
  Assignment operators assign value to variables
  Arithmetic operators perform calculations on numbers
  String operators combine strings into a single string
