<li>The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or underscores. Must not use dash or period.</li>
<li>Variables cannot use keywords or reserved words. Ex. var</li>
<li>All variables are case sensitive and it's bad practice to create a name with a different case</li>
<li>A name should have a description of the information that it stores.</li>
<li>You should follow camelCase the first word of the variable should be lowercase and all other should be upper</li>
