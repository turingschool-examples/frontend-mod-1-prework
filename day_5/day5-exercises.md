How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

You don’t have to specify how many values and array will hold when you create the array. You can add a few of the items on a list that you plan to use rather than including the whole list. As we already know, arrays can store data of different data types.To access the array, after the array name you specify the index number for the value (which, starts at 0) for that value inside []. You change it by selecting it and assigning a new value with =. So, you use the variable name = new variable.
