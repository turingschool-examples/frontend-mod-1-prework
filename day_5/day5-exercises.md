### 1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

#### 1. To declare a variable you must create it and give it a name. Var is an example what programmers call a keyword. In order to use that variable you must give it a name. Sometimes it is called an identifier. An example would be var quantity; in this case the variable is called quantity. The equal sign is an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable. An example is var quantity = 3;

### 2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

#### 2. Numeric data types handle numbers such as 1224 or 0.50. You do not use commas when writing out the numbers. String data types consist of letters and other characters. Such as 'Hi, Kyle!'. Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. An example would be var inStock: inStock = true;

### 3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

#### 3. Rule number one is the name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It must not start with a number. Rule number two is the name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. You must not use a dash or period in a variable name. Rule number three is you cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to describe a variable. Rule number four is that all variables are case sensitive so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases. Rule number five is to use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name. Rule number six is if your name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, firstName rather then firstname (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash). Some reserved words are var, function, delete, true, and return are just some keywords that are reserved.

### 4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

#### 4. Array can be useful when you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. They are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how values it will hold. For example, an array would be helpful when creating a shopping list because it is a list of related items. To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets. You can change the value of an item in an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item).

### 5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

#### 5. An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two types of expressions. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable (var color = 'brown';) and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value (var area = 2 * 4;).

### 6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

#### 6. Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. Assignment operators assign value to a variable (color = 'brown';). Arithmetic operators perform basic math such as area = 2 * 4;. String operators combine two strings such as greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly';.
