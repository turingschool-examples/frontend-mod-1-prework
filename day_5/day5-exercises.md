CHAPTER 2

You declare a variable by first giving it a name (identifier).
The equals sign says that you are going to assign a value to the variable.
This is called an assignment operator.

NUMBERS numerical data type that handles numbers
STRINGS letters and other characters representing tex
BOOLEANS data type containing one of two values: true or false

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore
2. Can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or underscore. CANNOT include a dash or period.
3. Cannot use KEYWORDS (special words that tell the interpreter to do something) or RESERVED words (words that may be used in a future version of JS)
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of info the variable stores.
6. camelCase. Capital letter for each word AFTER the first.

ARRAY stores a list of values.
To ACCESS a value, you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.
To CHANGE a value, select it and assign a new value using the equals sign and the new value for that item.

EXPRESSIONS evaluate into a single value.
STATEMENTS complete line of code that performs an action

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS assign a value to a variable
