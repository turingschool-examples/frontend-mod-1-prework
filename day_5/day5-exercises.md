### 1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

You declare a variable by creating a variable with the keyword *var* and giving it a name. In JavaScript the equals sign assigns a *value* to the variable. It is also used to update the value given to a variable. This is known as the *assignment operator* in JavaScript.

### 2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

* Numbers are integers (ex. 1 2 3 4 etc.)
* Strings are text (ex. 'Hello! World')
* Booleans have one of two values, true or false.

### 3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

    1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an underscore.  It must not start with a number.

    2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore.  Note that you must not use a dash or a period in a variable name.

    3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words.

    4. All variables are case sensitive.  

    5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

    6.  Use camelCase if your variable name is made up of more than one word.

### 4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

Arrays are useful when working with a list or a set of related values. Arrays are useful in allowing you to create a list of many items without knowing how many values it will need to hold.

You access values in an array as if it were a numbered list.  To access the value, you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets. Additionally, you can change a value in an array by assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable.


### 5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

* A statement is an individual instruction that the computer follows.
* An expression evaluates a single value.  It does a calculation or changes something to create a single value.

### 6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?

* Assignment operators - Assign a value to a variable.
* Arithmetic operators - Perform basic math.
* String operators - Combine two strings.
