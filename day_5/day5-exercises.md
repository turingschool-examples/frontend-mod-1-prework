1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
  `var name;` declares a variable;
  The `=` sign gives a value to the variable;
  It is called an assignment operator;

2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
  Number/Numeric Data: counting, calculating;
  String Data: Letters/characters w/in quotes, can contain HTML markup;
  Boolean Data: true or false, like a light switch to activate other software functions;

3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
  (1) The name must begin w/ a letter, dollar sign (``$``), or underscore (`_`). Can NOT start w/ a #;
  (2) Name can contain letters, `$`, or `_`, but no `-` or `.` in the name;
  (3) Can NOT use keywords/reserved words. Ex: `var`;
  (4) Variables are case sensitive, score and Score would be different variables. But it is bad practice to use both of these kind of variables together;
  (5) Use names that describe the kind of info the variables stores;
  (6) camelCase names with multiple words within it. Ex: thisIsCamelCase;

4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
  Arrays keep related items together in a list;
  To access/change a value in an array, call the variable w/ the index # of it's order (it starts at 0, not 1);
  Ex: ``colors[2] = 'beige';``

5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
  Each individual instruction/step in a script is a STATEMENT;
  An EXPRESSION gives a single value w/ an assignment operator. It can be used to assign values to variables, or to perform arithmetic;

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?
  ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: assign a value to a variable;
  ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: perform basic math;
  STRING OPERATORS: combine 2 strings;
