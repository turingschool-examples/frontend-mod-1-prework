#### Chapter 2 Questions

1. **How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?**
  >In JavaScript you declare a variable by naming it. This is the first step into activating a variable. The equal sign it the way you begin to define the variable by assigning it or updating a specific value. The assignment operator (equal sign) is the symbol for assigning a value to a variable.

2. **There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.**
  >Numbers are any numeric value (integer) that can be used for any type of calculation. Sums and counting can be easily performed and numbers do no use commas. Negatives and decimal points work well.
  >Strings are any combination of letters and characters that add text to the site. They always use opening and closing quotes. It is not strict with single or double quotes, except with the starting and ending quote. HTML Markup is used.
  >Boolean is also known as a true / false statement. In terms of determining what kinds of script is to be run at a certain moment, it can be thought of as an on / off switch.

3. **What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?**
  >The rules are as follow:
   * names must begin with letter, $, or _. Never a number.
   * do not use dash or period in variable names.
   * do not use keywords / reserved words. Reserved are the ones that might be used in JavaScript in the future and can be found online.
   * case sensitive and it is bad practice to use same var name with uppercase or lowercase. That is just confusing.
   * Names should describe information stored in var.
   * Use camelCase
  Some examples of reserved words are package, delete, function and while.

4. **How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?**
  >An array allows you to create an indexed list of values that for the most part are related and at the same time can have a mix matched set of variable types like boolean and numbers in the same array. These list are easily edited by following its index numerically to refer to its position in the list. Using the array as a keyword and using the desired index location number in parenthesis you can retrieve data from an array. By using brackets and an equal sign you can also substitute a value for a new one in a set array. The equal sign changes the value that should be in '' and closed with a semi-colon.

5. **What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**
  >Statements is what they call every single line of instruction in a script. Every step is a single statement. An expression is a type of statement which assigns a value, either through a string, a math formula, compare or even do some good old logic.

6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?
  >* Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. An arithmetic operator performs basic math and provides a single result value. Comparison operators are able to return boolean true or false answers.
