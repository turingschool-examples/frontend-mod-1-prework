Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays:

1) The process of declaring a variable first starts with creating the variable and giving it a name. You do this by starting with the variable keyword 'var' followed by the variable name, or identifier. Once you have created/ declared a variable you can assign it a value which is what tells the variable what information to store. This is done by using an equal sign, which is called the assignment operator, and followed by the variable value. In JavaScript the equal sign (assignment operator) tells that you are going to assign a value to the variable.

2) Numeric data types handle numbers that are used in tasks such as counting and calculating sums, along with determining size, position of an element. They use numbers 0-9 and do not utilize commas but can be negative or decimals.
Strings data types consist of letters and other characters which are enclosed within a pair of quotes. They are used when working with any kind of text as well as when you need to add new content into a page.
Boolean data types have one of two values: true or false. One can think of them as an on or off switch and can be very useful when determining which path of a script should run.

3) The six rules for naming variables are as followed:
  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore and *cannot* start with a number.
  2. The name **can** contain numbers along with letters, numbers, dollar signs or underscore. You *cannot* use dashes or periods in the variable name though.
  3. You *cannot* use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are the special words that tell the interpreter to do something. An example of this would be the 'var' keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are the ones that are used by the syntax of JavaScript
  4. All variables are case sensitive, so a capitalized word vs a lower case word would be different variable names. It is bad practice, though, to create two variables that have the same name but different cases.
  5. Use a name that describes the information that the variable stores.  
  6. If the variable name is made up of more than one word, start with lowercase for the first word, followed by uppercase for the remaining words. There should be no spaces between any of the words.

  As stated in rule number 3 you can not use reserved words in variable names, some of these include: class, true, public, float, void, return, case, false, and default.

4) An array can be useful when dealing with lists or sets of related values because, for one, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. This is helpful because it removes the need to create enough variables for a long list, i.e. numbers 0-100. When you create an array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.
You can access a value of an array you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets after the array name. You can also change a value in an array by first selecting it and then assigning it a new value just as you would with any other variable.

5) Expressions are units of code that to produce a value, such as instances, literals and operators. Statements, however, are units of code that represent one or more instructions and are implemented to make something happen.

6) Three types of operators are:
  1. Assignment Operators - With this type of operator you tell the variable what information you would like it to store by assigning a value to the variable. (e.g. color = 'red')  
  2. Arithmetic Operators - These types of operators can be used with numbers to preform basic math.
  3. String Operators - This operator involves combining two strings, with the + symbol, to create a new string/ single value.
