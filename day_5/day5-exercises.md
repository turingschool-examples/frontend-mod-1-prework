<h3>How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?</h3>

You declare a variable by giving it a name. This consists of using the variable keyword, var, followed by its name in camelCase. The equals sign in Javascript is called an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable.

<h3>There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</h3>

Numbers are just as they sound, numbers. Numbers are not just used for things like calculators; they are used for tasks such as determining the size of the screen or moving the position of an element around the screen. String data types consist of letters and other characters. String data types are enclosed in a pair of quotes. Boolean value types can have one of two values: True or False.

<h3>What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?</h3>

1. The name must begin with a letter, a dollar sign ($), or an underscore. It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, dollar sign, or an underscore. Note that you must not use a dash or period.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Some examples of reserved words  to avoid are boolean, true, false, typeof, null, and var.
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. This is known as camelCase.

Some reserved words in JavaScript to avoid include boolean, break, case, if, false, null, return, package, static, and while.

<h3>How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?</h3>

Arrays are especially helpful when you don't know how many items a list will contain because, when you create an array you do not need to specify how many items a list will contain. To access a value from an item in an array, after the array name you specify, place the index number for that value inside square brackets. You can change the value of an item in an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item)

<h3>What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</h3>

An expression results in a single value. While statements are a step in a series of instructions known as a script.

<h3>What are three types of operators and how are they used?</h3>

Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. Arithmetic operators perform basic math. String Operators combine two strings.
