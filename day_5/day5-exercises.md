Chapter 2
1. To declare a variable, you must give it a name.  By giving a variable a name, it allows the the developers to determine how these variables are used within in program. In JavaScript, the equal sign is an assignment operator where a value is assigned to a variable.  The equal sign in JAvaScript is called an "assignment operator".
2. Numbers: A numeric data type that handles numbers. <br />
String: A string data type that consist of letters and other characters. <br />
Boolean: A boolean data type can have one of two values: true or false.
3. Rule 1: The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. <br />
Rule 2: The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore.  You must not use dash or period in a variable name. <br />
Rule 3: You cannot use keywords or reserved words. <br />
Rule 4: All variables are case sensitive. <br />
Rule 5: Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. <br />
Rule 6: If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use capital letters for the first letter of every word after the first word. <br />
Some reserve words that we should avoid when naming our variables are: boolean, byte, false, switch, let, and else.
4. Arrays are useful when you do not know how many items a list will contain.  When you create an array, you do not need to specify how many value it will hold.  To access an array, you go to the value within the square bracket of an array.  To change any value of an array, you simply select and assign new value within the desire value.
5. Expression produces a value in Javascript and a statement is what is actions used to provide or calculate those values.
6. Assignment operators: Assigning a value to a variable. Example: length = '5cm'. <br />
Arithmetic operators: Perform basic math. Example: area = 75 * 5. <br />
String operators: Combine two strings. Example: fullName = 'Jim' + 'Hendrick'.
