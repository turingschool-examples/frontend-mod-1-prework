## JavaScript - Chapter 2

## How do you declare a variable? What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
You declare a variable by creating the variable and giving it a name. In JavaScript, the equals sign is an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable. It is also used to update the value given to a variable.

## There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
The numeric data type handles numbers. This is for tasks that involve counting or calculating sums, and use numbers 0-9. The string data type consists of letters and other characters. This is enclosed within a pair of quotes (e.g ‘Hey, you!’). The Boolean data type can have one of two values: true or false.

## What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore. It must not start with a number.
- The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore. Note that you must not use a dash (-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
- You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
- All variables are case sensitive so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
- If your variable name is made up of more than one words, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. This is referred to as camelcase. For example firstName rather than firstname. You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
- JavaScript Reserved Words: abstract Boolean break byte case catch char class const continue debugger default delete do double else, etc.

## How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets. You can change the value of an item in an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (using the equals sign and the new value for that item).

## What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
An expression evaluates into a single value. A statement can have a variable evaluate into different values.

## What are three types of operators and how are they used?
Assignment Operators – Assign a value to a variable (e.g: color = ‘beige’;)
Arithmetic Operators – Perform basic math (e.g: area = 3 * 2;)
String Operators – Combine two stings. (e.g: greeting = ‘Hi ‘ + ‘Molly’;)
