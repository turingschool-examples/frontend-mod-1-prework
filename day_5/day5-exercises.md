1. You declare a variable by using the variable keyword (var) and then giving the variable a name.
The equals sign is an assignment operator in JavaScript. It is how you assign a value to a variable.

2. Numbers store numerical data. Numbers can be positive or negative and can be integers or
decimals. Strings store letters and other characters. They are enclosed with quotation marks.
Booleans are either true or false. They function as a switch for the code to interpret.

3. 1 - Variable names must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore (not a number). 2 - The
name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore (no dashes or periods). 3 -
Donâ€™t use keywords or reserved words. 4 - Variables are case sensitive. 5 - Variable names
should be descriptive. 6 - Name your words using camelCase (lowercase first word, uppercase
subsequent word) or with underscores. Some examples of reserved words to avoid using are
break, delete, class, const, catch, and continue.

4. Arrays come in handy because they can be added to if you are unsure of how many items you
will need to store right off the bat. It can be used for assorted data lists like shopping items,
names of people in a class, or colors for a website. You can access and change an item in an
array by using its index. For example, in var myArray = [24, 56, 87];, you can use myArray[0] to
access the value 24 and myArray[0] = 13 to reassign its value to 13.

5. Expressions always result in a single value. They can assign values to variable or use multiple
values to return a single value. Statements are instructions to perform a specific action.

6. Assignment operators (=) assign a value to a variable. Arithmetic operators (ex: +, -, *, /) perform basic math. String operators (+) combine two or more strings.
