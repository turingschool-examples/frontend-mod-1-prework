## Read Chapter 2 (Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays) from JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development
Answer these questions about the reading in your day5-exercises.md file:

<strong>How do you declare a variable?</strong><br />
By announcing that you want to use it, so creating it and giving it a name. Programmers say that you declare the variable.<br />
<strong>What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript?</strong><br />
The equals sign is a an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable. It can also be used to update the value given to a variable.<br />
<strong>What is it called in JavaScript?</strong> assignment operator.<br />

<strong>There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.</strong><br />
Numeric data type handles numbers(integers) 0-9 to make any size number, positive or negative, can determine size of screen, table, box, move position of an element, can be decimal too(float). String data type consists of letters and other characters, enclosed by single or double quotes, used when working with any kind of text and can contain HTML markup. Boolean data types have one of two values: true or false.Can help determine which part of a code should run.<br />

<strong>What are the six rules for naming variables?</strong><br />
Must start with letter, $, or underscore, NOT a number, or a dash or a period. However the name itself can contain letters, numbers, $, or an underscore. No keywords or reserved words. Do not use same variable name with different cases. Use a name that actually describes the ting you are describing. If more than one word, put together using camel case or underscore between words, no dashes.<br />

<strong>What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?</strong><br />
For example delete, return, var, new, case, basically function names, variable names and loop lables.</strong><br />

<strong>How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values?</strong><br />
Because it stores a list or a set of values that are related to each other. It's also convenient because you don't have to specify how many values/list items it will hold.  
<strong>How do you access/change a value in an array?</strong><br />
You access it by specifying the index number for that value inside square brackets. You can change the value of an item, an array by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable (equals sign and new value for specified item).<br />

<strong>What is the difference between an expression and a statement?</strong><br />
An expression has two ways to be used, first way: it evaluates into a single value, second way: it uses two or more values to return a single value.
A statement is an individual instruction or step and should end with a semicolon.</strong><br />

<strong>What are three types of operators and how are they used?</strong>
Assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. Arithmetic operator performs basic math. String operator combine two strings, (There are comparison and logical operators too).
