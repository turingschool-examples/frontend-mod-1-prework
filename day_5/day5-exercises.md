## Read Chapter 2 (Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays) from [JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1541447422&sr=8-5&keywords=duckett)

Answer these questions about the reading in your `day5-exercises.md` file:


1.  How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

- "var" is the _keyword_ used to represent a variable which in Javascript is used in place of numbers or many other kinds of data.
- since "var" is a very general term, the variable _name_, (aka. the *_identifier_*), direcly follows, and together they are the process that _declares the variable._ 
- To assign a value to the variable ("var" + name), an _assignment operator_, better known as an equals sign (=), is used   
- The variable _value_ goes directly after the (=) _assignment operator_ which officially _defines_ the value.


2.  There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

- Number data types made up of only numerical data which includes integers, (whole numbers) like 4 or 2, and floats, (decimals) such as 3.14. 
- String data is contained within quotes and can be alphanumeric data. 
    - For example, a "name," or date "02/14/2020." 
- Boolean data points have two values, true or false, and are helpful for triggering scripts.


3.  What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

- (1) Names must begin with a dollar sign, underscore, or letter, but not a number  
- (2) dots and dashes cannot be used in the name 
- (3) keywords that have a specific command used by the interpreter cannot be used as variable names 
- (4) variables are case sensitive 
- (5) names of the variable should be informative
- (6) camelCase should be used for variables with more than one word or underscores are also acceptable


4.  How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

- Arrays can store an undefined amount of items in a list so you don't have to make a separate variable for each
- To access a value from an array, you must write the array name, and in square brackets, input the index number in the array 
- Use the equal sign to change the value, and then write the updated value in quotation marks


5.  What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

- Expressions yield a single value    through the use of an assignment operator or through the calculation of two or more numbers. 
- Statements resemple steps in a process 


6.  What are three types of operators and how are they used?

- Assignment operator (=) equal sign: defines a value by pairing a declared variable with a value  
- basic mathematic functions are calculated using Arithmetic operators   like division (/) and subraction (-) 
- The String Operator (+) is used to join two sets of strings together into one
