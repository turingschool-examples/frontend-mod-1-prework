## How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript? ##
**Variables** define bits of stored data or information. A variables data is temporary and can change, *or vary*, each time you run a script command. Variables need to be declared and given a name. To declare a variable a programmer will use an identifier, which is simply the name following the keywords "var".
**Equal Signs** are called assignment operators. An equal sign tells the webpage you are going to assign a value to the defined variable.

## There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are. ##
**Numbers** are straight forward - they handle numerical data. Anything working with numbers in integer or decimal form, from a page size to a timer.
**Strings** contain text. This text can be data for the page to load in, numbers, or HTML markup. Strings are good for storing character data, and are enclosed in quotes.
**Booleans** store true/false operations. They help direct the webpage when operating the code. For example they can control when a certain line of code runs, or doesn't run.
**Undefined** is the fourth data type, when a value has not yet been assigned.

## What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names? ##
1. It may not start with a number. It must start with a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore.
2. It may not contain a dash or a period. It may contain, anywhere, a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore.
3. You cannot use keywords, or words that have a function in computer language, such as return or new.
4. Although it is possible to repeat variable names, because variable names are case sensitive, it is bad practice.
5. It is good practice for the variable name to relate to what the variable is storing, like a hint or label.
6. And remember, you cannot use a dash, so if your name is multiple words camelCase is preferred. camelCase capitalizes each word *after* the first.

## How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array? ##
Arrays are useful because they tell the programmer that the information stored is related. They are also useful to the programmer when the number of items to be stored is unknown. Values that are separated by commas in arrays are automatically numbered, starting with 0. To access a value in an array the programmer calls on a number that is paired to a specific value, and placed in brackets, along with the arrays name. Example itemFour = food [3]. This calls on the fourth item in the array named food. Furthermore, to change a value in an array, you again call on the paired value with its number, and using the assignment operator (=) change the value with quotes.

## What is the difference between an expression and a statement? ##
Expressions require operators to create a single value, similar to math equations. The single value can come from operations performed on multiple values, into one, such as multiplication or addition. Operators are directions for the expression to use. Examples of operations are addition, subtraction, and increment.
Statements are known as individual instructions given to a script for the computer to follow.

## What are three types of operators and how are they used? ##
1. Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. This could be a numerical or characters.
2. Arithmetic operators perform a math function. Including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, decrement, and modulus. It's important to note parentheses affect the order of operations in arithmetic operations.
3. String operations combine sets of character strings. The + symbol is the operation identifier, combining the characters contained in quotes on either side of the +. The difference between addition in arithmetic operations and addition in string operations is the + in string operations contains letter characters on either side, not numbers.
