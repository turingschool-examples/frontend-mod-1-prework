## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

<<<<<<< HEAD
+ An object is used to store *key-values*.With objects, your data is assigned to a **key**, where with Arrays the values are stored to an ***index***, where they store ordered lists. Furthermore, objects can contain any data type, where arrays are more focused and use strings to retrieved data.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

``var petStore = {
  dogFood: 150,
  catFood: 250,
  petToys: 5000,
};``


1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

``state.IA;``


1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?


``state.MN = "Minnesota";``


1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

<<<<<<< HEAD
+ We might use an array over an object when we're adding a new student to a roster for an entire college; this would contain quite a lot of data! Even more, we need to add this student to a list in a specific order, say by our student's majors. By using an index (with arrays) to perform this task we would be able to easily add that student into a specific place.

+ On the other hand, say we want to change a property of the school's Sociology department. We have a field of study, a departmental advisor, a schedule and a calculated pass/fail rate, and we need to modify the pass/fail for the year. We could manipulate this with an object since the data types are all related to this department.

1. What questions do you still have about objects?

+ I'm still relatively solid on everything at this point. When things come up I'll be sure to reach out if Googling fails me!
