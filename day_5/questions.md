## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

*An object is used to store *key-values*. With objects, your data is assigned to a **key**, where with Arrays the values are stored to an ***index***. Furthermore, objects can contain any data type, where arrays are more focused.*


1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

``var petStore = {
  dogFood: 150,
  catFood: 250,
  petToys: 5000,
};``


1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

``state.IA;``


1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?


``state.MN = "Minnesota";``


1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

*An object might be used if we wanted to add a method to a list of items.*

1. What questions do you still have about objects?

*I'm still relatively solid on everything at this point. When things come up I'll be sure to reach out if Googling fails me!*
