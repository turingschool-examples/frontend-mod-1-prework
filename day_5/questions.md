## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  Arrays are used to store a list of values. Objects group together properties that all apply to the same object. An array can be included in an object.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

var petStore = {
dogBed: 8,
catNip: 5,
chewToy: 20,
birdSeed: 13,
fishFood: 17
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

console.log(states.IA)

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

states.MN = Minnesota

1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

You might use an object when creating code about a car. An object is better than an array because an array gives specific examples for one car but an object can be adjusted for any car.

1. What questions do you still have about objects?

I am feeling pretty good about objects but like with everything else more practice will really lock it in.
