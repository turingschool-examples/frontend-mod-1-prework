## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a variable that holds multiple lines of data. An array doesn't differentiate data types its just a line of different elements, an object has different data with different values on each line.

2. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This Object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
var petStore = {

dogToy: 25,
catToy: 20,
fishFood: 40,
dogFood: 50,
leash: 35,
};

3. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.IA = "Iowa"

4. How would you add a new property to that Object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?
states.MN = "Minnesota"

5. What is another example of when we might use a Object?  In this case, why is an Object better than an Array?
When we want to store specific data tied to a certain element. An array is great for writing a group of items, but if we want detailed information about each of those items that when an Object shines.

6. What questions do you still have about Objects?
I feel like I got a grasp of this concept pretty well and quickly. If I had to ask something though it would be is there a limit for the amount of properties an object can have? When should I use bracket notation instead of dot notation? Only when accessing a string?
