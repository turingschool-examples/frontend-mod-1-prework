## Day 5 Questions

#### 1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

- An object is similar to an array in the sense that it stores multiple pieces of information however it is a lot more complex
- An object is basically a variable with more options. Objects are perfect for when you want to create an instance of a thing because you can give an object a name and store every kind of value in that object that you can think of from arrays to strings to functions.

#### 2. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
var petStore = {
  location: "1234 Centennial Ave"
  dogFoodBags: 50,
  catFoodBags: 40,
};
```

#### 3. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

- `console.log(states["IA"]);`

#### 4. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

- `states.MN = "Minnesota";``

#### 5. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

- An object may be used to create a character in a video game
- This would make an object the preferred varible over an array because an array can not store a character's methods/functions

#### 6. What questions do you still have about objects?

- None at this time
