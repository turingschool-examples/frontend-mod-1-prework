## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  An object groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something we would recognize from the real world. It is like a container containing like things together. Objects are different than Arrays in Javascript is that Objects are unordered list and uses curly brackets. Arrays are ordered list because it is numerically ordered and uses square brackets.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  var petStore = {
  name: "Pet Smart",
  food: 100,
  foodType: ["dog", "cat", "fish"],
  toys: 150,
  };

1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

    states.IA

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

    states.MN = "Minnesota"

1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

    We might use an object when for example you are setting up a realtors page, you have your var = House1, and below it list out how many bedrooms, bathrooms, what is the price etc. In this case object is better than array because the things in the house doesn't need to be in an ordered list. They can be in any ordered but we want it to be within a certain container of codes. 


1. What questions do you still have about objects?
    I am still unsure if I understand the full definition between the differences between object and arrays.
