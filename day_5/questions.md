## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is similar to an array in that it holds multiple values but in an object the values are not sequential and objects can hold different *kinds* of values like strings and booleans and integers.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

var petStore = {
  name = "Chris' Pet Store"
  dogFood = 15,
  catFood = 20,
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

var homeState = states.IA

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

"MN": "Minnesota"

1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

An object is better than an array because can hold all types of data and even functions in no particular order
