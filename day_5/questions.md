## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

    * In my mind, an object is like a variable, but it has multiple components, called properties. I am organizing it in my mind this way because and array can be part of an object. Objects can also have methods.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

    ```
    var petStore = {
      cats: 8,
      dogs: 4,
      fish: 57,
      snakes: 5
    }
    ```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

    ```
    states.IA
    ```

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

    ```
    states.MN = "Minnesota"
    ```

1. What is another example of when we might use an object?  In this case, why is an object better than an array?

    * An array is simply a list. An object can be only a list, but it can also include arrays or methods/functions. It has more options for what it can do.

1. What questions do you still have about objects?

    * I have a feeling I will have a lot. But for now, I think I am grasping the basics of it.
