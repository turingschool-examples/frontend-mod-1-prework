## Next Steps

Depending on if you are in Section A or B, you have anywhere between 1.5-3.5 weeks before you start Mod 1. This is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this pre-work. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...
- What are you going to work on? Resources here.
I am going to continue the typing practice with typing.io. I also found a more generic typing practice site, and I will use both. I have access to more JS practice from sources like codecademy.com, so will practice there.
- What days are you going to work?
For now, I plan to work a little bit every day. I will be going on a family vacation at the end of September, so probably won't do much work then.
- What times on those days are you going to work?
Right now I'm at my best coding earlier in the day. I will be working in the morning after breakfast, usually 9:30 am to noon.
- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
I will be at my table in the dungeon (I mean, my parents' basement...)
- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
I am using iCal and the GTD organizational system to document my plan.
- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
Yes. My parents know that this is happening.
- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)
I am handling a few doctors appointments during this period. And I will be heading on the family trip here soon. All of these are in my calendar already with many alarms.

## Deliverables

In the appropriate thread in your pre-work group channel, share the the plan that you developed in the Next Steps section. The point is sharing is to collaborate and inspire - potentially find opportunities to work together on some things, maybe show an organizational strategy you have with others, or just see the thought your cohort mates are putting into this as well, so you don't feel alone! That being said, don't shy away from sharing your _detailed_ plan. This is a great chance to support each other in staying accountable to this plan.
