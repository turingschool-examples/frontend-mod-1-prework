## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

// I'm comfortable asking questions, but I am also independent and like to figure problems out on my own. There is always a time and place for questions as stated in the articles, and I believe my timing is appropriate for them. I think I something wait both too long and act too soon, but depends on the topic. For Turing, I think it may be too long, trying to figure the problems out take more time than I realize, seems like hours just fly by.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

// It felt fine, I did have to refer back to S1 for notes on one piece, it was uncomfortable not having it right in front of me. Overall, I think it supported the learning process, I now remember the node command very well.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

// Conditional statements contain an "if this, then that" premise. Life example: If it is 4pm, then it is Lottie's dinner time. Web example: In Spotify, if you favorite heavy metal bands, then your featured artists will be including more artists of similar sound.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

// You can use "else if" and "else" to add multiple conditions. The program reads the statements as if it is checking boxes, verifying the information one after another and formulating the response based off of the information provided in the variables pursuant to the rules written in the conditionals.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

// You can use the logical operators to verify that two conditions are met. && to verify both are met, || to verify if 1 of 2 conditions are met.

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

// Functions allow customization of the output using input generated elsewhere.

1. What is a parameter? What is an argument? Why would you use one? Provide an example of a function that accepts an argument (declaration and call), and indicate what the parameter is and what the argument is.

// A parameter is a variable only housed within that specific function. An argument is the parameter's entry in the call line with the customized data. Example: parameter is "aircraft" and argument is "Boeing 777", the parameter is in the function line at top, and the argument is in the call line below.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

// I actually feel relatively good about both. Would like more practice, but in due time. If anything, I would like more of a description on how and when to use logical operators, I was hung up longest on that while working on this section.
