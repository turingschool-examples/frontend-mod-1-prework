## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I'm pretty good at asking questions at the right time. If anything I er on the side of waiting too long, primarily in group situations or when asking higher-ups (because, just like in the articles, I don't want to look underqualified to my superiors). In class settings I tend to wait until after class (in case my question gets explained and it allows for more time to ask/ask follow-up questions) or even later after I have time to try and figure it out on my own.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I didn't feel like it was more difficult than Section 1; if anything I liked having multiple outside sources as it gives a more well-rounded look at the topics being taught. I think it would be much more difficult and uncomfortable if we were meant to find these sources on our own. I believe that every lesson or article gives a certain perspective on a topic, but even the *best* article only gives a single perspective. By giving the opportunity to look into multiple perspectives we can better formulate our own explanations on how things work.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement says what to do based off of certain conditions; based on an if/then/else format. A daily life example would be "if I am hungry, then I will eat, else I will wait until I am hungry." A web application example would be "If the user is logged in, then the screen will display 'Welcome back!', else it will ask them to log in."

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

An `if` statement on it's own will look at a condition and will execute it's program if true or do nothing if false. One can add an `else if` statement to create another condition that will execute if true; these `else if` statements can stack to give a single `if` statement numerous answers. An `else` statement, placed at the end, will simply run of no other conditions are returned true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

In order to check if **both** conditions are met we can use the logical operator `&&`. In order to check if one **or** two conditions are met we use the `||` operator.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Is it best practice to be more specific (ie. make more `else if` statements) or to streamline as much as possible?
