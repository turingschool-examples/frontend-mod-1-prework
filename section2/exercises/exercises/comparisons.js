//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 10,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
console.log("The line is determining whether 4 is less than 9. The answer is true.");

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
console.log("The line is determining whether the variable of books is greater than 4. As the number of books is 3, the answer would be false.");

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
console.log("The line is determining whether the variable friends is greater than the variable siblings. friends is listed as 6, and siblings is listed as 2, therefore the result would be true.");

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
console.log("The line is determing whether the variable of attendees is not equal to the number of meals. attendees is listed as 9, and meals is listed as 8, therefore the result would be true.");


//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);


// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay || age);
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: It resulted in true as I consider a 1 year old dog to be a puppy. I chose to use the || as it only determines false is both returns are explicity false.

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
  // as you would expect?
