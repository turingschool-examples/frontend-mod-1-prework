## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is used to determine which action should be performed based on the response to the statements. A daily life conditional would be "If I read for an hour, I can play video games. If I do not read for an hour, I need to clean my room." Depending on the true/false nature of reading, there is a different action based on the if/how the condition is fulfilled. A conditional statements is used on Twitter "If the tweet is 180 characters or less it can be posted, if it is greater than 180 characters display a message telling the user to shorten their message".

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
You want to use an if statement when you want a certain block of code to be executed given that a certain specified condition is true. When using an if statement in
isolation (without else), the code will only be executed if the condition is true, nothing will happen if the condition is false.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
You use && to separate the conditions. An example of this would be if you wanted a block of code to be executed if ((cupsOfFlour >= 2) && (hasSauce = true)) like we did in one of our examples!

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
We also used conditional statements when executing for loops. The loop is run given a set of conditions (there is a condition on where the for loop should start - initialization and where the for loop should end - condition)
