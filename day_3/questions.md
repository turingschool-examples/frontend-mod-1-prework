## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A **conditional statement:** is one where a decision must be made.

  * e.g.: Is it too loud outside? If yes, close the window. If no, keep the window open.
  * e.g. 2: Are you allergic to nuts? If yes, you can't eat the cookie. If no, you can eat the cookie.
  * e.g. 3: Is it your bedtime? If yes, go to sleep. If no, you can play.


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  You might want to use an *if*-statement when you want to give a script two or more options of what could happen next. What happens next is determined by what condition is met.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

  ```JavaScript
  if (condition) {
    // code to execute when above condition is met
  }
  ```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  You can add multiple conditions to an if statement by using `||` or `&&` between the two conditions.

  `if ((condition) || (condition))` or `if ((condition) && (condition))`

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

  ```JavaScript
  if (condition) {
      // code to execute when one condition is met
  } else if (condition 2) {
      // code to execute when another condition is met
  } else {
      // code to execute for all other conditions
  }
  ```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  Another way to use a conditional statement is a [switch statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch).
