## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement resolves to true or false depending on the state of the code when it runs.

-( true == false ), resolves to false since they are not equal
-( positiveInteger >= nonNegativeInteger && ( booleanVariable ) ), resolves to true if and only if booleanVariable is truthy and positiveInteger is greater than or equal to nonNegativeInteger
-( numberOfFingers === 5 ) resolves to true if numberOfFingers is 5

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

You don't always want to run every piece of code available, so an if-statement allows you to run it only when appropriate.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

if ( < conditional statement > ){

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You could nest if-statements, or you can use 'and', 'or', or 'xor' operators to link conditional statements.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

if ( < conditional statement > ){
  [code]
}
else if ( < conditional statement > ) {
  [code]
}
....[some number of else-if-statements]
else {
  [code]
}

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

How long to run a loop forß.
