## Day 3 Questions


### 1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is a command that executes based on whether or not a condition is met.


**if** asks whether or not the condition is true.

**else** means *otherwise*

**else if** statements evaluate a block of code when their condition is true.


### 2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

An if-statment would be used to notate a condition. Using an if-statement, allows a code to evaluate an expression and decide what to do next based on the status.


### 3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

```
if(<condition>){
(<code to execute if condition is true>):
}
```

### 4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

Two conditions can be added to the if-statement by using `&&` between the two conditions.

### 5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

```if (condition) {
  //  block of code to execute if condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to execute if condition is false
}
```

### 6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

A **switch** statement is also a conditional statement. It chooses only one of many code blocks to execute based on the condition status.
