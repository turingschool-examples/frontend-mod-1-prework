## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
-It's a statement that allows us to perform different actions based on different conditions in Javascript.

-An example of a daily life conditional would be if you are able to sleep in or not based on your work schedule. If It's Saturday or Sunday, you can sleep in past 7. If it's Monday-Friday you must wake up by 7.

-A conditional that I can think of that is used in a web application is when using Uber. When you begin searching for a ride and enter your address it then asks you to choose a ride based on your price point, how comfortable or if you would prefer a luxury vehicle, and how many people you have in your ride. If you want a basic ride with a basic vehicle and hav 4 people or less you would choose UberX. If you would want a newer vehicle and nicer ride thats a bit more expensive, you choose Comfort. And if you have a party of 5 or more then you would choose UberXL.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
You use this to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
```if (condition) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you must use an `if/else` statement.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
```if (condition 1) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (condition 2) {
  //block of code to be executed if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true
} else {
  //block of code to be executed if the condition 1 is false and condition 2 is false
}
```
6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Not at this moment, i'm coming back to this question.
