## Day 3 Questions

___

**1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.**

A conditional statement is a statement based on if/then/else. Ex; IF I finish day 4 THEN I get to play Animal Crossing ELSE I continue to work until I finish day 4.

IF the cats have not been fed THEN they get fed ELSE they do not get fed more.

IF it is after 17:00 THEN I get to drink beer ELSE I drink tea.

**2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?**

If statements are good for running scripts that revolve around uncertainty.

**3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?**

if (condition) {
   statement1
 }
else {
   statement2
 }

**4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?**

By using a '+' !

**5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?**

if (condition1) {
  statement1
}
else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
...
} else {
  statementN
}

**6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?**

Well!! I can really only think of other ways to use them outside of writing code? I suppose? They're a good tool to use to organize tasks and make sure you're being productive.
