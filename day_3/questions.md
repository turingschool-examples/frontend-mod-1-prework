## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is an if...then statement.
If I order pizza then I tip $5
If I drive over the speed limit then I get a speeding ticket
If the dog drinks all his water then he has to go to the bathroom.
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
In order to create a repeating the loop that stops itself. This way you don't have to type out commands for potentially thousands of logs to the display.
1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?
if (var variable = ____) {
  do this command;
} else {
  do this command;
}
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can compare multiple conditions in the if statement. Inside the initial () you can use multiple commands to compare criteria.
Logical and: ((variable1 condition) && (variable2 condition)) means that both of these conditions have to be true.
Logical or: ((variable1 condition) || (variable2 condition)) means that only 1 of these conditions has to be true.
1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?
if (var variable1 < 0) {
  do this command;
} else if (variable1 = 0) {
  do this command;
} else {
  do this command;
}
You can use any criteria inside the () of the if and else if statements. You can use as many else if () as needed to create the loop.
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Switch statements allow a variable to be compared to a list of values (each value is called a case). The variable being turned on is compared to each case.
