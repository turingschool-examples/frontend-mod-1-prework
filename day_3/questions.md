## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement says what to do, in this case it tells the computer what code to execute or action to take in a given situation, usually in regards to a returned value whether that be a boolean or int etc.

An example of a daily life conditional could be "If I am not at work by 8am, I am considered late."

An example of a conditional being used in a web application would be something like "If I click the checkout button and my bank account has less money than the cost of the items, the transaction will be declined." Also, "If there IS enough money in my bank account, then a calculation will occur to subtract the cost of items from my bank account total."

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
To set up a condition for a certain code block to execute based on whether a boolean returns with a true of false value.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
It begins with the keyword "if" followed by the condition in parentheses, and lastly the code you want to execute inside a pair of curly braces.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
By running if/else after your first if statement, therefore create a chain of conditional statements that will be evaluated one by one if the previous statement is not equal to the declared variable or variables.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
It is similar to the syntax of the beginning if statement. You start your first if/else statement right after the closing curly braces of the opening if statement, and repeat the same syntax for each if/else statement in this chain of conditional statements.

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement? There is a "switch" statement which allows you to have a default option if none of the other cases/statements match. If a match IS found, then the "break" statement stops the rest of the switch statement from running, apparently providing better performance than multiple "if" statements. The example in the javascript book has a switch labeled "level" and a different message to be output depending on what level of the test they are on, 1, 2, or 3. If none of these are true, which would be the case at the start of the test, the default message of "good luck" will be output because none of the other conditions match.

(I hope I understood correctly what you meant by syntax for questions 3 and 5. I assumed you wanted to know what order things go in, as well as the proper punctuation used).
