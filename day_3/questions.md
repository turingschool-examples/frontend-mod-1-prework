## Day 3 Questions

A conditional statement evaluates a situation by comparing a value from the script to the value one thinks it is, thus evaluating whether it is true or false.

} else if (condition 2) {
  console log("if condition1 = false, and condition2 = true");
} else if (condition 3) {
  console.log("if condition1 = false, and condition2 = false, and condition3 = true")
} else(* optional) {
  console.log("if none of the other conditions are true")
};

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
