## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement in code, when met, executes one or more statements. Or, if not met, will do something different. examples are: *if/else/then*

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

If you are writing code in which you'd like to return one result only if certain conditions are met (like a score being below 50%).

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  console.log(message1);
}
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

by including the addition of an `else` statement:
```javascript
if (condition1) {
  console.log(message1);
} else (condition2) {
  console.log(message2);
}
```

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  console.log(statement1);
} else if (condition2) {
  console.log(message2);
} else {
  console.log(massage3);
}
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Other conditional statements could be used in other loop operations like a when-statement or a while-statement.
