## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is based on on a set of conditions using if/then/else. It says what to do based on a given situation. One example would be when I'm entering a username and password with a website, it'll either be correct and let me through or incorrect and make me re-enter my credentials.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?

One would want to use an `if` statement when they're trying to evaluate/check a condition.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
```
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if evaluated to true
}
```
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?

If wanting to add more conditions to an `if` statement, the `if/else` statement should be used.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
```
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition evaluates true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if condition evaluates false
}
```
6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Another way to use a conditional statement is a `switch` statement.
