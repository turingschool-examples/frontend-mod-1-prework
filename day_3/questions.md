## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  * A conditional statement is based on the outcomes/concepts of if/then/else. If a condition is met, then the code executes one or more statements.
    1. If I hit my head on the ceiling, then I will say ouch
    2. If my shoe is untied, then I will trip
    3. If my shoe is untied, then I can tie it ("else" from previous example)

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  * You might want to use an if-statement to label the difference outcomes and code block executions of certain conditions.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?
  * if (condition1) {
    block of code if condition1 is true
  }

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  * You would use the "else if" statement to add multiple conditions to an if statement.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?
  * if (condition1) {
    block of code if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
    block of code if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  }

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  * We might want to use a conditional statement to determine what code needs to be run when a statement is true and/or false (else if).
  * Conditional statements also help set perimeters to code and allow for multiple outcomes based on the variable information.
