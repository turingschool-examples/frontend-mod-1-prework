## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are based on a concept of if/then/else... 
If a condition is met then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different (or just skips the step)
Three examples:
1) If statements
2) If..Else statements
3) Else...If statements

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

If statements evaluate (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates to be true, any statements in the subsequent code block are then executed.


1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?
The Javascript syntax for an if statement starts with the keyword if followed by parentheses which encapsulate the condition, and then curly braces carry the code to execute if the value is true.

if (//condition) {
//code to execute if value is true;
}

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
to add multiple conditions to an if statement you would add an else statement to it 

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

if (condition1) {
// block of code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition 2) {
// block of code if condition 2 is true
} else {
// block of code if all conditions above are false
};

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
To set an alarm for a specific time, or when to change the temperature on a thermostat.
