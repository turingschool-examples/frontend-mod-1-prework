## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

The conditional statement tells the code what to do in a given situation (in "if else" or "else...if" scenarios)
a. I don't have enough money for a gumball
b. I don't have enough money for a gumball
c. I can make pizza

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
An if statement would be used if you only want to give the code one possibility, this would be ideal for "press any key to continue". Any key you press will get you to the next phase but if you don't do anything nothing happens

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

if (var = value) {
  console.log("");
}

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
Instead of having 1 value inside the parenthesis you can use the "&" symbol to add more than 1

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an else...if statement?

if (var = value) {
  console.log("");
} else if (var = value) {
  console.log("");    
} else{
  console.log("");    
}

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Conditional statements can also be used to insert values to present to the user *outside of* an it statement such as the following: "console.log("You enter a dark room with two doors. Do you go through #1 or #2?")"
