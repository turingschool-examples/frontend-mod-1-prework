## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a statement that evaluates to true or false. If statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is true. Else statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is false.
   * If it is sunny, then you will need to wears unscreen
   * If it is hot out, then you will need a water bottle
   * If it is cold out, then you will need a coat

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You would want to use an if statement to specify different outputs to different conditions when they are met. For example, if you wanted to write code to rank a score & exclaim "congratualtions!" at specific thresholds, then you would use an if statement to determine whether or not the conditions have been met to post your congratulatory output.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can add multiple conditions to an if statement by using ```&&``` which stands for AND.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  code to run if condition is false
}

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
You could use a conditional statement to display certain text based on different choices that the user makes. In researching different examples of conditional statements, I found switch statements which take a single value as input & look through different choices of corresponding output until one that matches the value if found & then executes the corresponding code that goes along with that value.
