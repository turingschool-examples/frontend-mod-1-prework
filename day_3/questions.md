## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is something a script uses to make a decision. The statement identifies if a certain
criteria is met, and then starts running a corresponding part of the script.

Most of the time, this shows up as the if statement. *If* this happens, *then* do this.

*If* it's raining outside, *then* stay inside.
*If* you feel hungry, *then* make food.
*If* the user's password is incorrect, *then* print an error message.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

If-statements allow the script to react to ways the user interacts with the site. If the user clicks this, then do this.
If the user clicks something else, then do this. If-statements allow the site to be more interactive.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

```
if (variable = value) {
    then do this
}
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You use the *else* keyword.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

```
if (variable = value) {
    then do this
} else {
    do this
}
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

I imagine conditional statements are used pretty frequently with logins. Instead of using the if statement
as a tool for decision making, using it for validation of credentials might work.
