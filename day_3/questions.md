## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  You use conditional statements in code to make decisions based on the variable input. Three examples of conditional statements are:

  if - you use if to run a block of code if the condition is true

  else - you use else to run a different block of code if the condition is false

  else if - you use else if to test a new condition if the first condition is false.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  If there is more than one possible input for a variable you would want to use an if-statement.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

  if (condition) {
    code to run if true
  }

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  To add multiple conditions to an if statement you would use else if.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

  if (condition) {
    code to run if true
  } else {
    code to run
  }

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

I cannot. At least in what we have learned so far I believe you need an if-statement to begin a conditional statement.
