## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
> A conditional statement is a way to create a more complex response in decision making. If a condition is met (or read as true) then the assign response is provided. An example of a daily life conditional would be asking a friend if they are at your house yet. If they say yes, you will go let them in, if they say no you might ask them when they will arrive, if they say anything other than yes or no, you would likely ask for more information. A conditional used in web applications might be in a shopping cart of a website. The condition could be regarding discount codes. If the item has a discount code equal to 20% off, the price will change, if the discount code is equal to 30% the final price will change, but if it doesn't have a discount code, the total price would remain the same.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
>As a way to tell a computer to do one thing or another. It provides options and a way to preform different actions based on varying conditions.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
> if ('condition') { <br>
>  console.log("one output") <br>
>} else { <br>
>  console.log("other output") <br>
>}

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
> To add multiple conditions to an if statement you can use logical operators of && (and), || (or), or ! (not). This allows you to create an if statement that considers multiple conditions while evaluating.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
> if ('condition') { <br>
>   console.log("output 1") <br>
>} else if ('condition2') { <br>
>   console.log("output 2") <br>
>} else if ('condition 3') {<br>
>   console.log("output 3") <br>
>} else { <br>
>   console.log("other output") <br>
>}

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
>Perhaps something that doesn't just tell the program which code block to run, but with its condition could tell the program to run a whole set or code blocks to run, or activate a different set of choices for the program to work through.
