## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement performs certain code sections depending on the outcome of the original condition, whether true or false. In daily life, you might say that 'If I am going outside, then I will put on shoes.' In a web based application, if the user wants to sign up for the newsletter, then ask for their email address.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
- To make decisions, and respond to certain user inputs or conditions.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
```
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
- Through the use of `else` or `else if` statements that folow the `if` command.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
```
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
- To apply a catch all to any type of input the code was not expecting. This would allow us functionality if the user tried to break the code.
