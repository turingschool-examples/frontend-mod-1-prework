## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement compares values. If something passes its condition then it usually is set to return a log. If it doesn't pass that statement, but passes a different statement (else if) then it will return a different log. If the statement doesn't pass any of the conditions then it will return a different log altogether (else).

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
If statements are used for decision making. If a user chooses a certain statement then I would want them to see a specific output. If they decide to choose something else then I would want to show a different output.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?
if (condition); {
  <executeCode>
}

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can use the statement "else if" if the original statement is not met, yet you wish to check another statement. You can use "else if" multiple times to check if conditions are met for any of them. After using "else if" you should close out your statement with a final "else" if none of the previous conditions were met. Although we haven't gone over AND and OR statements, I do understand these are other ways to add conditions to a statement.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?
if (condition); {
  <executeCode>
} else if (condition2) {
  <executeCode2>
} else {
  <executeCode3>
}

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
This is kind of a tough question. For something to be "conditional" it has to match something else. In that case we could technically have other designations that provide conditions, i.e. "bring out the food 'when' it is ready", or "play ball 'on the field'". However all of these statements can be broken down into a more basic conditional (if).
