## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A conditional statement is a value that is evaluated in an if/then/else statement. The result is either true or false.

  Three examples of conditional statements are (height >= 60), (scoopsOfIceCream == 0), (temperature <= 70).

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  You would want to use an if-statement to tell the computer what to do based on whether or not a certain condition has been met. For example, if (temperature <= 70) returns as true then the script may then tell me to take a jacket when I leave the house.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

  if (condition) {
    console.log(code to execute if condition is true);
  }

  Else could also be added if you wanted another piece of code to run based on a false return value.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  You can multiple conditions to an if statement by using else if.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

  if (condition1) {
    console.log(code to run if true);
  }else if (condition2) {
    console.log(code to run if c2 is true);
  }else {
    console.log (code to run if neither condition is true);
  }

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  I feel like I should have a better answer here, but the idea of a conditional statement is based on the premise of an if/then scenario. So, no, I can't think of any other ways it might be used.
