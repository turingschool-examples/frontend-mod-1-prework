## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

``A conditional statement lets the computer know to do one thing if true, then for all others that are not that one thing to do something different.``

``A real world example would be to check and see if you can go for a long walk today. If it's raining and your dog refuses to go outside, you wouldn't be able to go. If not, then you could go for your long walk!``

``A web application example would be something like using set parameters to find a Tasker on Task Rabbit. Say I needed to have a couch moved. If the Tasker has a truck, the other Taskers that do not have a truck would be weeded out. I could continue my search in this manner until I've narrowed down the list to include the specifications that I require in a Tasker.``

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

``We would use an if-statement to find out a specific condition is true or not.``

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?

``if (condition) {
    //block of code if condition1 is true
  }``

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

``We use else/if statements to do add more than one condition.``

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?

``if (condition1) {
    //block of code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    //block of code if condition1 is false and condition2 is true.
} else if (condition3) {
    //block of code if condition1 is false and condition2 is false and condition3 is true.
} else {
    //block of code if none of the conditions above are true.
};``

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

``We might use conditional statements in loops, as well.``
