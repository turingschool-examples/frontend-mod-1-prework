## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement determines the next step in a script. Conditional statements control the course of your output in JavaScript and basically determines what pieces of code to run next. Getting gas would be an example of a conditional statement. Is the gas tank <= to halfway full. If true, then the conditional statement would read "Go get gas!" A lot of websites will ask are you 18 or older as a conditional statement. If age is >= 18 than true. Next step would be access to the site.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
if it is a conditional statement and to determine the next step. Use if to specify a block of code to execute, if a specific condition is true.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
else if

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
'else' if the condition does not match any of the conditional statements. This allows the output to default to whatever might fall under 'else'.
