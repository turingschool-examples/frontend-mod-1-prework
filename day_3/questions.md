## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a statement that uses conditional operators and the statement evaluates to either true or false.
If (i > 5) would be a conditional statement. If i = 3, this statement would be false.
If (magazine == "Vogue") is another conditional statement. If magazine was Wired, the statement would be false.
If (corona === "Negative") is also a conditional statement. If corona = Negative, the statement would be true.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You might want to use an if-statement if you want to have a certain outcome happen based on user input.

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if statement?
If () {
  code to run;
} else {
  code to run;
}

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
If (conditional statement && conditional statement) {
  code to run;
} else {
  code to run;
}

1. What is the JavaScript syntax for an if/else if/else statement?
If (conditional statement) {
  code to run;
} else if (conditional statement) {
  code to run;
} else {
  code to run;
}
You can write multiple else if statements.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
You can use conditional statements in loops also; the loops only run while the conditional statement that sets up the loops still evaluates as true.
