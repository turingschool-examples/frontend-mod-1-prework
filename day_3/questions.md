## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.  
- A conditional statement checks whether or not a certain condition is met, and will execute different code blocks depending on the parameters of the conditional if statement.
- In the morning, *if* you are hungry you will eat, *else* you will not eat.
- On spotify, *if* you are a premium member, you have unlimited skips and no commercials, *else* you will have limited skips and commercials.


2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?  
- To check if the user falls under a certain set of parameters, and adjust the code block executed based on whether on not they meet those parameters.  

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?  
- `if (condition){
    execute this code block if condition is true;
  }`

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?  
- Using the `&&` (and) or `||` (or) operators.  

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?    
- `if (condition){
    execute this code block if condition is true;
  }else if (condition) {
    execute this code block if condition is false;
    } else {
    execute this code block;  
  }`  

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?  
- Conditional statements can be used for verification of conditions in loops, nested loops, and switch statements.
