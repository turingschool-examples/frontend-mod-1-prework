## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement is one that takes into account a changing variable and performs different actions depending on that choice.
- If I wake up and (eat breakfast, I won't be angry until lunch.) (skip breakfast, I will be extra hungry at lunch.)
- Netflix has a "Are you still wacthing?" flag that gives you the option of choosing yes or no, the former allowing you to continue, the latter closing the show.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
- You would want to use an if statement if there is a choice that has to be made or if variables are changing throughout the process, producing different outcomes based on those choices.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
- if (condition) {
  <your code here>
}

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
- you would use else if as shown above as many times as needed to handle the multiple conditions properly.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
- if (condition1) {
  <your code here>
} else if (condition2) {
  <your code here>
} else{
  <your code here>
}

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
- I believe there is a switch statement where different code is used depending on the variable chosen but I have not practiced with it.
