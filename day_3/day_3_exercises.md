## Chapter 7   
1. While using an input element in a form, the action attribute controls the behavior of that input.  
2. The <select> element is used to create a dropdown list.  
3. To send a form to the server, the type attribute should be set to "submit".  
4. To group similar form items together, one would use the "fieldset" element.  
  
## Chapters 13 and 15
1. Border vs. margin vs. padding:  
  -Border: The border separates the edge of one box from another.  
  -Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of the margin top create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.  
  -Padding: The space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
2. To use shorthand references for padding, four numbers listed in pixels will represent top, right, bottom, and left respectively.
3. Block level elements take up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it. Inline elements take up only as much width as necessary and do not force a line break.
4. Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window - when users scroll down the page, it stays in the same exact place. When using this type of positioning, elements can often overlap. To combat this, you can use a z-index. The higher the number associated with a z-index, the closer that element is to the front.
5. Fixed layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
