# Day 3 Exercises

### Chapter 7

1. The value of the ‘type’ attribute will determine the behavior of the input.
2. The `<select>` element is used to create a drop down list box.
3. It should be set to “submit”.
4. `<fieldset>` is used to group related form controls together.

### Chapters 13 & 15
1. The border is the physical line, no matter if it’s set to a zero value, that is the outside of the box. The margin is the amount of space on the outside of the box between the box and any objects next to it. The padding is the space between the border of the box and any of the content that is inside of the box.
2. The 1 corresponds to the top, 2 to right, 5 to bottom, and 10 to the left side.
3. Block level means that only 1 element takes up the entire line, while inline elements means that multiple elements will be evenly spaced on the same line.
4. Fixed positioning ensures that an element will remain in the same spot on the webpage, regardless if you scroll down or adjust the window in any other way. The z-index is important because it clarifies the layers of different elements once they are overlapped by the element that is being left in a fixed position, which should almost always have the element in the fixed position occupying the first layer, while all other elements then are hidden underneath that element.
5. Fixed layouts do not change if the browser window is shrunk or expanded, meaning a user might have to scroll side to side to see aspects of the page. These elements are also typically created with fixed sizes given in pixels. A liquid layout means that the layout of the page will stay the same, and elements will increase and decrease with size to remain in the same position. These elements are typically created with percentages dictating their size.
