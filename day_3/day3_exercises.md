    1.  Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
            ``border: separates boxes. Every box has a border even if it is not visible

            margin: space outside of border that you can set to a certain size to separate borders of different boxes.

            padding: the space between the border of a box and the content withtin the box.``

    2.  For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
              ``1px: top
                2px: right
                5px: bottom
                10px: left``

    3.  Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
        ``Block-level elements start on a new line and they take up the entire width of the parent element. Inline elements do not need to start on a new line. They can start next to each other, taking up the amount of width designated to them, but not the entire width of the parent element``

    4.  What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

        ``this makes sure an element does not move when the user scrolls. It is in a "fixed" position in the browser. z-index makes sure boxes dont overlap when taken out of "normal flow". It lets you designate which box will appear on top``

    5.  What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

         ``fixed width layouts do not change size if the browser increases or decreases size and liquid layouts do.``
