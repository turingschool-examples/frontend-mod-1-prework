1. The "type" attribute controls the behavior of the input element.
2. The <select> element is used for a dropdown box.
3. The "type" attribute should be "Submit"
4. <fieldset> is used to group similar form items together.

1. Border: Every box is surrounded by a border. Borders separate the edge of one box from another.
   Margin: Controls how much space is between the borders of adjacent boxes.
   Padding: Controls the space between the border of a box and the contents within it.
2. The pixel values correspond in clockwise order. "padding : top, right, bottom, left"
3. Block level elements create a new line and extend the width of its parent element.
   Inline elements do not start a new line, can be located inside Block level elements, and its width is determined by its tags.
4. Fixed positioning keeps the element visible and in a set position at all times when scrolling through a page. The z index is important for fixed positioning because the element could potentially block content which could be annoying for the user, or intended (in the case of ads).
5. Fixed layouts do not change in size as a user increases or decreases their screen size; usually coded in pixel size.
Liquid layouts stretch and contract as a user increases/decreases screen size; usually coded in percentages.
