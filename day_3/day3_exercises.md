4. **What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?**

Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the browser window. This means that this element will never move even as the user scrolls up and down the page. Z-index is important in this situation as it determines which element appears on top of which in the event of an overlap, this ensures your fixed element will appear over others.

5. **What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?**

Fixed layouts remain the same size regardless of the user increasing or decreasing browser window size. Liquid layouts, on the other hand, stretch and contract to fit the user's window
