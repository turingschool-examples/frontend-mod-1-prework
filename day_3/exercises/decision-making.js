In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
file from your terminal with the command `node day_3/exercises/decision-making.js`

If/Else Statements are expressions your program uses evaluate to different outcomes.
Below is a dynamic story that is created based on the value of three variables: doorChoice, bearClothing, bearChoice.
Spend some time changing the variables and running the file to see how the story changes.

Reflection Questions
1. In English, using technical vocabulary, describe what is happening between lines 17 and 21.
It looks like were strictly saying that if we chose door 1 then we recieve the message "hat" and if we choose any other door then we recieve the "scarf" message.

2. What variable has a new value assigned to it after the first if statement executes?
The bearClothing line.

3. If you changed the variable doorChoice to equal 3, what would the bearClothing value be?
"sunglasses"

4. In English, using technical vocabulary, describe what is happening between lines lines 31 and 38.
The code is strictly determining which bearChoice dialoge will return based on the if/ else if/ else conditional statements.
5. If you changed the variable bearChoice to equal 3, what will be the final outcome be?
I would run into a room that is full of snakes.

6. If you changed the variable doorChoice to equal 1, and the variable bearChoice to equal 2, what will be the final outcome be?
The poor bear would start crying.

7. What is your favorite ending?
I would have to say the else statement in which I would become best friends with the bear.
