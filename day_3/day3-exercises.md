Forms:

1.  If you're using an input element in a form, what attribute controls the behavior of that input?

The input type attribute controls the behavior. This can dictate what type of input your form has. So if one put input type = text then it would be an empty form for text input only. Or if someone put input type = password then the code would know itâ€™s a password field.

2.  What element is used to create a dropdown list?

The select element is what creates a dropdown list.

3.  If you're using an input element to send form data to a server, what should the `type` attribute be set to?

The "type" attribute should be set to "text" or a text input element.

4.  What element is used to group similar form items together?

The fieldset element.

Boxes and Layouts:


1.  Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

Border goes outside the box, margin sits just outside of the edge of the border and padding is the space between the boarder and the contents of a box.

2.  For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?

They are in clockwise order starting from left to right: top, right, bottom, left.

3.  Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.

Block level starts on a new line and inline elements flow between surrounding text.

4.  What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

Fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window. Sometimes, boxes can overlap. Z-index is important because you can control which element sits on top in that scenario.

5.  What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

Fixed layout doesn't change in size with the user increasing or decreasing the size of the page while liquid layout does just that.
