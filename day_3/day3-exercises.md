1.  **Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.**
  Borders separate the dimensions of one box to another. Margins are like a 'moat' around the border, it creates room between boxes. Padding is the space between the inner contents and the border, it's like breathing room for the content.
2.  **For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?**
  Values start from the top side and go in clockwise order: `Top 1px, Right 2px, Bottom 5px, Left 10px.`
3.  **Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.**
  Block-level elements take up the entire width of their parent container. Inline elements start adjacent to the previous element on the same line.
4.  **What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?**
  Fixed positioning allows elements to overlap, rather than pushing other content outside of its box. Z-position is important to indicate which content in the overlap appears on top.
5. **What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?**
  A fixed layout keeps its width no matter the resolution of the browser display. Liquid layouts, however, shift contents of the page around to fill gaps depending on the resolution of the browser display.
