<p><h3>Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.</h3></p>

<i>
<b>Border</b>- The border separates the edge of one box from another
<br>
<b>Margin</b>- You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
<br>
<b>Padding</b>- Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
</i>
<br>

<p><h3>For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to</h3></p>
     <i>This represents a values in a clockwise order: top, right, bottom, left. 1px-top, 2px-right, 5px-bottom, 10px-left</i>
<br>

<p><h3>Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.</h3></p>
        <i><b>Block-Level</b>- Is an element that creates a new paragraph on the webpage or in general spans the entire length of the web page. Elements like < p > or < ul > < li > are block-level elements. </i>
        <br>
        <i><b>Inline</b>- Element which width only extends to its closing tag. Something like < b > or < strong > are inline elements. </i>

<p><h3>What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?</h3></p>
<br>
       <i> Fixed positioning allows you to "float" an element in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element. The reason for z-index is to allow you to control which box appears on top </i>


<p><h3>What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?</h3></p>
 <i> <b>Fixed layout</b> do not change in size as the user increase or decreases the size of their browser windows. This layout uses pixels for measurements. </i>
<br>
      <b>Liquid layout</b> change with the size of the browser windows, stretching and contracting. This layout tends to use percentages for measurements.</i>
