Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

  - The border, even if it is not visible, separates the edge of one box from another.
  - The margin sits out side of the border and can be adjusted to add space between boxes.
  - The padding is the space between the border and the contents of a box.

For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?

1px = top of the box, 2px = right side, 5px = bottom, 10px = left side

What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

Fixed positioning allows you to position an element in relation to the browser window rather than the containing element. Fixed elements don't affect the position of surrounding elements and stay fixed even when the user is scrolling. The z-index property helps you control how boxes overlap meaning that you could position a fixed element on top of a background element so that it is always visible.

What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

A fixed layout does not change size based on the size of the user's browser window. A liquid layout will expand and contract based on the size of the user's browser window.
