Forms:
1. The `type` attribute controls the behavior of the input.
2. The `category` element creates a dropdown list.
3. `type="submit"` sends data to a server.
4. `<fieldset>` groups similar form items together.


Boxes & Layout:
1. A border separates the edge of one box from another. A margin is outside a border and creates space between boxes. Padding is the space between the border and the contents of a box.
2. 1px: top, 2px: right, 5px: bottom, 10px: left.
3. Block-level elements start on a new line and inline elements flow in between the surrounding text.
4. Fixed positioning pulls an element out of normal flow and keeps in in the same place in relation to the browser window, not the other elements on the page. It is useful for things like navigation bars and headers. Z-index is important in this scenario because it controls which element sits on top, so the other elements won't appear in front of the fixed element.
5. A fixed layout does not change as the user changes their screen size and would appear the same on different screens. A liquid layout changes according to screen size and resolution.
