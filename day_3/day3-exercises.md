#### Chapter 7 on Forms questions;

1. When using an input element in a form the type attribute controls the behavior of that input.

2. The select element is used to create a drop down list box.

4. The element that is used to group similar form items together is the fieldset element.

#### Chapters 13 and 15 on Boxes and Layout questions;

1. The differences between border, margin, and padding are; a border separates the edge of one box from another (borders will always be there even if you cannot see them), margins are outside the edge of the border causing a gap between the borders of two boxes, and padding is the space between the border of a box and any content within that box.

2. For a CSS rule for padding within a box, 1px represents the padding-top, 2px represents the padding-right, 5px represents the padding-bottom, and 10px represents the padding-left. This is what each pixel value corresponds too.

3. The difference between block-level and inline elements is inline elements are `<img>`, `<b>`, and `<i>`, these elements flow in between paragraphs while block-level elements are `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, these elements start a new line and act as the main building block.

4. The role of fixed positioning is it positions the page to where when a user scrolls up and down on the page, the element will stay in place. Z-index is important in this scenario because boxes can overlap and when you use the Z-index property you can control which element sits on top and the higher the number, the closer the element will be to the front.

5. The difference between a fixed and liquid layout is a fixed layout does not change the sizes of the boxes as the user changes the size of the browser window while a liquid layout stretches and changes the size of the boxes as the user changes the size of the window.
