## 2. What element is used to create a dropdown list?

The select element is used to create a dropdown list, and the option attribute is used to specify options for the dropdown.

## 3. If you're using an input element to send form data to a server, what should the type attribute be set to?

## 1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

Padding controls the space between the contents of a box and its border.

Borders outline the boundary of a content box, and effectively separate the edge of one box from another.

Margin is the space outside of a box's border, and can be used to dictate how close a content box can get to another.

## 2. For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?

Top: 1px
Right: 2px
Bottom: 5px
Left: 10px

## 3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.

Block-level elements sit on their own line by default. Line-level elements can be placed inline within or next-to another element.

## 4. What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

Fixed positioning is a form of absolute positioning that places elements on-screen in relation to the browser window.

Since absolute- and fixed-position elements are effectively removed from the document flow, these elements can overlap other elements positioned within the normal document flow. Z-index is used to control which elements overlap. I generally think of it as controlling the 3-dimensional order of elements.

## 5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

Fixed layouts don't change size as the browser window changes in size and dimension. They typically use pixels for measurements.

Liquid layouts do change size, and sometimes content ordering, and the browser window changes. They typically use percentages for measurements.
