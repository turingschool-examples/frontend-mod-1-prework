**What element is used to create a dropdown list?**

The element that is used to create a dropdown list is going to be the `<select` element. It also contains two or more option elements.

**If you're using an input element to send form data to a server, what should the type attribute be set to?**

The type attribute that you would use in an input element to send form data to a server would be the `submit` attribute.

**What element is used to group similar form items together?**

2. Part 2

**Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.**

`Border` Every box should have a border, even if it is not visible. The border will separate the edge of one box from another.

`Margin` Margins on the other hand will sit outside the edge of the border. You are able to set the width of the margin so that you can create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

`Padding` The padding will be the space between the border of a box and any content that is contained within it. This can increase the readability.  

**For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?**

For this CSS rule in padding, the sides of the content box that each pixel value corresponds to is 1px-top, 2px-right, 5px-bottom, 10px-left.

**Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.**

The difference between block-level and inline elements is that block-level boxes will start on a new line and will act as the main building blocks of any layout. On the other hand, inline elements will flow between the surrounding text.  

**What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?**

The role of fixed positioning is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window instead of the containing element. These will not affect the position of surrounding elements. The z-index is important in the scenario of using fixed positioning by is by showing which box will appear on top, thus, the fixed positioning will stop the boxes from  overlapping.

**What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?**

The difference between a fixed and liquid layout is that a fixed layout design does not change the size if the user is increasing or decreasing the size of their browser window. A liquid layout on the other hand designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window and it tends to use percentages.
