Questions pertaining to chapters 13 & 15.

1.  Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

    The border is the edge of the box separating one box from another. While the margin is the space from the outside edge of the border to say the edge of the page or what you define it to be. Padding is the space between the border and the box's contents.

3.  Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.

    Block-level elements will always appear on a new line and are the main building blocks of any website's layout. While inline elements will sit within a block element and not start on a new line. With the display property you can set one or the other to display as inline or block.

4.  What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

    Fixed positioning sets elements in relation to the browser window as opposed to the actual containing element. This doesn't affect any of the surrounding elements and it will not move when scrolling. The z-index sets up a hierarchy of what elements can stack over others. The higher the z-index the higher on the "stack" an element will be. With fixed positioning you may not want any elements to overlap as you scroll through content so the z-index could be used to make sure what is designed to be topmost stays there.

5.  What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

    Simply a fixed layout is not going to scale as a user increases or decreases the size of their browser window as elements are often defined in pixels. Liquid layouts adapt to the scale of the window and tend to use percentages. Both layout styles have advantages and disadvantages.
