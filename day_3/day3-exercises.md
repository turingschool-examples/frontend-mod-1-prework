## 3. If you're using an input element to send form data to a server, what should the type attribute be set to?
The type attribute should be set to the value of the type of input you'd like for your form. For example, you can set the type attribute to text, password, radio or checkbox. Each form control requires a name attribute, as well, to match the name with its value.

## Chapter 13 & 15

## 1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
Every box has a  `border` even if it's invisible. It's what separates the edge of one box from another. A `margin` is the space outside of the box's border. You can set the width to control the space between adjacent boxes. The `padding` is the space inside the box between the border and the contents within it.

## 2. For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
The values correspond with the following sides: top- 1px, right - 2px, bottom - 5px, left - 10px

## 3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
Block-level elements start on a new line and act as the building blocks of a layout whereas inline elements flow between surrounding text.

## 4. What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that fixes the element in relation to the browser window. When a user scrolls down the page it doesn't move. When you use fixed positioning, boxes can overlap, so it's important to use the z-index property to control which box appears on top.

## 5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
A fixed width layout does not change sizes as the user increases or decreases the size of their window, whereas liquid layouts stretch and contract. Liquid layouts tend to use percentages and fixed layouts tend to use pixel measurements.
