Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.


    Border- separates the edge of one box from another.
    Margin- sits outside the edge of the border; wider margins create a gap between the borders of 2 adjacent boxes.
    Padding- the space between the border of the box and the content within. Wider padding increases readability as your text doesn't touch your border.

For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?


    top:1
    right:2
    bottom:3
    left:10

Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.


    block-level elements start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout (also, extends into the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element)

    inline elements flow between surrounding text (does not start a new line and its width extends only as far as defined by its tags)

What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?


    fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window (as opposed to the containing element). Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page). Because these elements do not move, sometimes they can overlap with other elements. This is why it is crucial to use the z-index to ensure the element you wish to stay at the front (or most prominent) stays there.

What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

    Fixed layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. (Also, measurements tend to be in pixels).

    Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. (Measurements tend to be in percentages).
