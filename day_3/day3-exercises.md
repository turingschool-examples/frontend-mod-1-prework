Chapter 13 & 15

1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

Border - Every box has a border even if it is not visible or set to 0px wide. The border is meant to separate the edge of one box from another.

Margin - They sit outside the edge of the border. Can be set to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

Padding - The space between the border of a box and any content in it. Helps with the readability of its contents.

2. For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?

1px = top
2px = right
5px = bottom
10px = left

3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.

Block-level elements expand naturally in their containers starting on a new line. While inline elements flow in one line between surrounding text.


4. What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

Fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window. They do not effect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls. The z-index allows you to box appears on top and is then fixed like a title box.

5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

Fixed layouts do not change size as the user changes the size of their browser window. Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user changes browser window size.
