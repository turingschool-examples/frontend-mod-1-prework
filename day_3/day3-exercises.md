###Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
The border of an element is usually a thin line around the entire element. It can be visible, but doesn't have to be (and by default, is not.) The margin is the space between the element's border and other elements, and the padding is the space between the element's content and the border.

###For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
The top side will be 1px wide, the right side will be 2px wide, the bottom side will be 5px wide, and the left side will be 10px wide.

###Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
Block-level elements will create a new line for each element. Inline elements will stay on the same line as the elements surrounding it.

###What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
Fixed positioning allows you to specify if a box should have content flow around it, rather than be a block element. Z-index allows you to specify which box will appear on top of other boxes.

###What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
Fixed layouts will always be a certain width, no matter the size of the viewer's screen. This can sometimes lead to gaps on the side of the screen. Liquid layouts will expand to fill the viewer's screen, and will not leave any gaps.
