<h2> 1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.</h2>
Border: separates the edge of one box from another.
Margin: sit outside the edge of the border. Can be set to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
Padding: the space between the border of a box and any element contained within it.
<h2> 2. For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?</h2>
1px=top, 2px=right, 5px=bottom, 10px=left
<h2> 3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.</h2>
Block-level: alway appear on a new line.
Inline: sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.
<h2> 4.What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?</h2>
Fixed positioning keeps an element in the same place no matter where the user is on the page. It stays fixed when the user scrolls. The z-index property will determine what element sits on top. If you are using a fixed position and want the element to always be seen it is important to have high z-index.
<h2> 5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?</h2>
A fixed width layout does not change size as the user increases/decrease the size of their browser window. Fixed will normally use pixels. A liquid layout will stretch and contract as the user increases/decreases the size of their browser window. Liquid will normally use percentages.
