## Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
 The border separates the edge of one box from another. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

## For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
The pixel values are in clockwise order. 1px = top, 2px = right, 5px = bottom, 10px = left

## Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
By default, block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line.

## What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
Fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top, as boxes can overlap when elements are moved from their normal flow.

## What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
Fixed width layout designs do no change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels. Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements are given in percentages usually.
