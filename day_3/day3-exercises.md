1. *Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.* A border frames the outside of a box, beyond the padding. Padding is the space between the contents of the box and the border. Margins exist on the outside of the border, between it and other elements on the page.
2. *For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?* Padding is clockwise, so 1 px would be the top, 2 px would be the right side, 5 px, the bottom, and 10 px would be the left.
3. *Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.* Inline elements appear next to one another in a line, while block elements are on new lines.
4. *What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?* Fixed positioning determines an element's location in relation to the browser window. The fixed element will not move as the user scrolls up or down. Since elements can overlap outside of normal flow, the z-index is used to determine which box is on top.
5. *What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?* Fixed layouts don't change based on the size of the user's browser, while liquid layouts do.
