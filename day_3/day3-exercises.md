Chapters 13 and 15

Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.

  * A *border* separates the edge of one box from another. *Margins* sit outside of the border. And *padding* is the space between the border of the box and the content contained within it. Padding helps to increase the readability

For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?

  * The values are in clockwise order, so 1px is top, 2px is right, 5px is bottom, and 10px is left.

Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.

  * *Block level* elements start on a new line. They act as the main foundation for any layout. *Inline* elements will flow in between surrounding text.  

What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?

  * *Fixed positioning* positions the element in relation to the browser window instead of containing it. If an element has fixed positioning it will not affect the position of surrounding elements.

  * The *z-index* is very important because it allows you to control which box appears on top instead of having boxes overlap.

What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?

  * A *fixed layout* will not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.

  * A *liquid layout* stretches and contracts as the user increases or decreases the size of the broser.
