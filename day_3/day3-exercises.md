Chapters 13 & 15
1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
Border - Every box has a border. It is used to separate the edge of one box from another.
Margin - Margins sit outside the edge of the border. Setting the width of the margin can create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
Padding - Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can be used to increase readability of contents.

2. For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
10px - top
5px - right
3px - bottom
1px - left
(I think the 2px in this is a typo. 2px is value for margins)

3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
The content of block level elements are shown in a new line. Such as <blockquote> or <li>
Inline elements keep the contents in the same line. <strong> or <i>

4. What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
Fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window. When the user scrolls down the page the box stays in the same place.
Boxes can overlap when using fixed positioning. The z-index allows you to control which element will stay at the top.

5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
A fixed width layout does not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements are given in pixels.
A liquid layout stretches or contracts as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They use percentages for measurements.
