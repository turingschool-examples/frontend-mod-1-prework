HTML

1. The type attribute controls the behavior of input in a form. It can be text, password, radio, checkbox, file, submit, image, hidden, date, email, url, search, etc. The type attribute determines what types of input will be accepted and how they will be displayed.
2. The <select> element creates the drop down list (and the <option> element specifies the options that the user can select).
3. If you are submitting data to a server, you should use the type="submit" type attribute.
4. The name element is used to group similar form items. For example, if you have a "color" and "size" radio selection on your page, the color and size options should each be grouped by name so the website knows which options can be selected at the same time and which can't.

CSS

1. A box has a border, margin, and padding. The border is the barrier around each box. It exists even if you can't see it. Margin is the space on the outside of the border and padding is the space on the inside of the border.
2. When you list out values, it goes clockwise from top to left. So in padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, 1px is the top padding, 2 is the right, 5 is the bottom, and 10 is the left.
3. Block elements take up an entire horizontal section on a page. They create line breaks after the block element. Inline elements appear next to each other as single line elements. They don't have width and height settings. They listen to left/right padding but not top/bottom. Inline-block elements can sit next to each other like inline elements, but they still allow for height and width and top/bottom padding.
4. Fixed positioning allows an element to stay in the same place even if you scroll down in the page. Things like headers are often fixed, or a chat support window. Z-index is important to determine which element stays on top. You wouldn't want your header to be under your paragraph text, for example, so you give your header a bigger z-index.
5. Fixed layouts are always the same regardless of screen size. Liquid layouts adjust as your screen size adjusts (if you change your window size or if you're using a device with a differently sized screen).
