2. the `<select` element is used to create a drop down list.
3. If you're using an input element to send form data to a server you should set the type attribute to submit.
4. You can group similar form items together by using the `<fieldset>` element.

## Chapters 13 and 15
1. Every box has a border even though it may not be visible. The border is what separates the edge of one box from another. Margins sit outside the edge of the border, and you can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the edges of adjacent borders. Padding is the space that is between the border of a box and the content that is within it.
2. The values will go in clockwise order. So 1px is the top, 2px is the right, 5px is the bottom, and 10px is the left.
3. An inline element doesn't have any line break before or after it and flow between surrounding text, whereas a block element will start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout.
4. Fixed positioning is a form of absolute positioning that positions the elements in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. These elements do not affect the position of the surrounding elements, and they don't move when a user scrolls up or down the page. Z-index is important because it allows you to control which element sits on top so that boxes don't overlap. The higher the number is, the closer it will appear to the front.
5. Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user decreases or increases the size of their browser window, and the measurements tend to be in pixels. Liquid layouts will stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to be in percentages.
