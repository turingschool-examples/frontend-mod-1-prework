##Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
Border is what separates the edge of one box from another. Margin controls the amount of space between one border and the surrounding elements, Padding well control the amount of space between an elements content and its own border.
##For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
Rule padding starts from top and goes clockwise, so 1px is top, 2px is right, 5px is bottom, and 10px is left.
##Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
inline elements can appear within the same line on the document and flow between text. block elements will always start on a new line and provide overall structure to the layout.
##What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
Fixed positioning allows an element to be affixed to the browser window and is independent of other elements, meaning it does not affect or is affected by other containers on the page. Z-index is important because it establishes in what order should elements appear in terms of layering.
##What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
Fixed layouts give the designer a greater deal of control in terms of appearance and positioning of their page and elements will generally remain approximately the same to the rest of the page. However, the rigidity of it lends itself to problems if the user has settings that are slightly different than the designer such as resolution or screen size. Liquid layout will conform to the size of the browser window, contracting and stretching accordingly to fit the page and is thus more flexible across devices. Due to this variability however, the designer loses out on how they may have originally wanted the page to look and can lend itself to other technical issues such as long lines of text.
