## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * major resonance with being aware, taking a step back and asking 'Why am I feeling what I'm feeling?,' then taking action steps to disassociate from that mental tension
  * this does not need to be part of a daily routine/ritual; it's a tool when feeling frustration

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I have been working recently on being more aware of my emotions, particularly when they are getting in my way some. As per the growth mindset, I am realizing more and more that this is something I can influence with time. Often before I'd completely give up and just let my emotions take me where they will.

  * My gut reaction to struggle is still to instantly tell myself I won't get it or be incredibly frustrated *that I don't already get it.* A lot of my current work with growth mindset is pointed at this in particular.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * A web application I'm using a lot right now is... **GitHub!** One way it can be using an array is in our gists:
  ```javascript
  var myGists = ['session1_readings.md', 'session1_practice_tasks.md', 'session2_readings.md'];
  ```
  An Array is useful any time you need to make a list or collection of values (ideally same-type values) without needing to have each one labeled. In the above example, the strings listing out my gists don't need extra labels. If you wanted more labeling, you'd consider putting all of these values into an object with good key-value pairs.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  An array method is a specific and concise way to interact with an array and/or the elements therein. It allows us to specify a specific function to modify the array, and can be quite useful when put in a loop so it will repeat a number of times.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  The purpose of a loop is to specify a certain number of times that some lines of code are going to run repeatedly. Rather than writing it out every time, we simply state (with proper syntax) how many times the statements in the loop will run.

  I would use a loop in conjunction with an array most often to affect or change something about each value in the array. Iterating through an array is a fantastic way to do any number of things; often I can check values in an array, and if those values meet a specific condition, then I use a method to affect those specific values.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  I would pull out a few of their toys, and ask them to tell me the color of each of their toys. They'd point to each toy (assuming the 5 year old is paying any attention :P) and tell me the color. Once they'd gotten through the toys, they'd stop. I'd tell them that's exactly what I do with a loop. I check each item and do something with it, even something like "tell me the color."

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  I've seen while and for...in loops. I have not seen any for...of loops. So my biggest loop question is: how/why would I use a for...of loop.

  In terms of arrays, my biggest question is: how often are we dealing with nested collections in the real world? I've worked through examples of arrays of objects of arrays of objects before. How much actual nesting of data like that actually occurs?
