## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

// Using the SMART goals and kids learning how to code to develop their critical thinking. I hadn't heard SMART goals in a long time, it was nice to hear it reiterated as I had forgotten about it. Kids learning to code was new for me, but I can understand why schools would like to promote this kind of thinking. It is applicable to nearly everything you do in life.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

// I do in the way that I do set measurable goals for myself when needed. I like to start outlining a new task before tackling it head on, it creates milestones and checkpoints so I can gage my progress and feel like I have achieved something. I do not always see seeking help as a sign of strength. I do ask when absolutely necessary, but I often prefer to handle the issues on my own to come to the conclusion myself.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

// Likely in drop-down lists, they can list the different options available for the user to choose, streamlining the code's process in the selection instead of a freeform response which could delivery incorrect results.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

// An array is a data structure representing a group of related items. It is used to organize the data to be easily sorted and/or searched.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

// The purpose of a loop is to read through an array with less lines of code than manually writing all the desired lines out.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

// Loops can show you all the things within the array and show you the responses in a shorter way than writing all the lines of code out yourself.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

// None really, I found this fairly straightforward. I would like to learn more about the different methods we learned about earlier, looks like there are dozens.
