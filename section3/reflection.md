## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Something that I never thought of before is the importance of knowing where you have a Growth Mindset and where you have a fixed mindset. I feel that it is easy to fall into the trap of believing ones entire perspective is a growth mindset. I also liked hearing that some days are going to be fixed mindset days, and you can always try again tomorrow. Finally, the reminder that programming is about being tasked with challenges that will continue to push what one knows is always a good thing to hear.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think that when it comes to learning new things or practicing skills that I enjoy using I have a strong Growth Mindset; I'm always looking for new things to try or ways to improve the process that is currently being used. Where I fall in to a fixed mindset is in situations where I don't get feedback, whether from a person or from the work I'm doing, or if a problem is so vast I don't know where to begin with it. For the latter, when I was trying to redesign a workspace at a previous job it took a long time for me to make any headway because it was such a broad request I didn't know where to start and fell into a fixed view of what we had being the only way it could work. In the case of the former it can be easy to slip into a fixed mindset when you settle for your work being good enough and nothing is nudging you to push yourself more to see what you can do better.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Dating apps would use arrays of people to categorize groups of users a person has accepted, declined, and not seen. Youtube could use arrays to categorize a users bookmarked videos.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method modifies an existing array. They can add, remove, and otherwise alter arrays to prevent the recreation of entire arrays.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop allows for the automation of a single task in a block of code. This task can be a singular thing done numerous times, a stacking task that uses previous loop iterations, as well as working through data in arrays. One can use an array loop when wanting to pull all the data in an array without having to go through each item individually. Non-array loops can be used for math problems or running code a specific number of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop does something over and over again. When you have to pick up your toys you take one toy and put it away, one toy and put it away, one toy and put it away until it's all cleaned up. That is a loop. You do the same thing a lot of times until that thing is all done, and then you move on to something else.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

When do you use the `continue` and `break` functions in a loop?
