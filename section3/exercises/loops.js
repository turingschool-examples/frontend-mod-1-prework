In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
to achieve the desired result.

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

//-------------------
// LEVEL 1: Loops
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write code that logs to the console "I love hedgehogs!" 9 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  console.log("I love hedgehogs!");
}

// EXAMPLE: Write code that logs to the console the value of `i`, 3 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// What is logged to the console for this second example? Why?
// EXPLAIN:

//This logs 0, 1, 2 because it's asking to log the index i, starting at 0, going up to the limit of <3, and adding one each time.

 // YOU DO: Write code below that logs to the console, the sum of 2 plus 2, 7 times:

 for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
   console.log( 2 + 7 );
 };

 // YOU DO: Write code below that logs the String 'She sells seashells down by the seashore'
 // 10 times.

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log('She sells seashells down by the seashore');
};


//-------------------
// LEVEL 2: An Added Layer of Challenge
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write code below that logs to the console a String of "This is loop number: "
//that concatenates with `i`.

console.log('This is a loop number: ' + i)

// YOU DO: Using a for loop, how could you get an output that looks like this:

// 10
// 9
// 8
// 7
// 6
// 5
// 4
// 3
// 2
// 1

for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log('This is a loop number: ' + i);
};

// Not sure? Try to google some terms that seem relevant. Play around with it. Don't spend
// more than 15 minutes without making progress. If you are at 15 minutes and haven't made
// progress, that means it's time to reach out to your pre-work group on Slack!
