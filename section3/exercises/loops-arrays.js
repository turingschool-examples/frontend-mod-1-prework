Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and print
// each animal.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

// YOU DO: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and prints "The
// <animal> is awesome!" for each animal.

var animals2 = ["Butterfly", "Rabbit", "Bumblebee", "Spider"]

for (var i = 0; i < animals2.length; i++) {
console.log("The " + animals2[i] + " is awesome!");
}

// YOU DO: Create an array of foods and then iterate over that array to log "Add
// <food> to shopping list" for each food item.

var foods = ["Cucumber", "Spinach", "Cabbage", "Tomato"]

for (var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
  console.log("Add " + foods[i] + " to shooping list");
}

// YOU DO: Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to log double
// of each of the number. (Ex: 4 doubled is 8.)

var numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i] * 2);
}


// YOU DO: Using the array of names below, print out "Happy Birthday <name>" for
// each name except the first two.
var names = ["Sevy", "Lindsey", "Jericho", "Raeonna", "Latrina", "Jhana", "Luca"];

for (var i = 2; i < names.length; i++) {
  console.log("Happy Birthday " + names[i]);
}

// THE FINAL YOU DO: Using the array of ages below, print out a statement for each age.
// The age should determine which message is printed out:
  // Under 18? "Oh no, you can't vote quite yet."
  // 18 or over? "Make sure you get out and vote!"

// WORD FROM THE WISE: Before you start coding, jot down, with pen and paper, what steps you
// want to tell the program to take. Think of all the concepts you've learned so far.

// Remember, stuck for 15-20 minutes? Reach out to your pre-work group on Slack.

var ages = [17, 20, 34, 18, 16, 65, 49, 10, 22, 18];

for (var i = 0; i < ages.length; i++) {
  if (ages[i] >= 18){
    console.log("Make sure you get out and vote!");
  }else {
    console.log("Oh no, you can't vote quite yet.");
  }
}
