In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and print
// each animal.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

// YOU DO: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and prints "The
// <animal> is awesome!" for each animal.

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log('The ' + animals[i] + ' is awesome!');
};

// YOU DO: Create an array of foods and then iterate over that array to log "Add
// <food> to shopping list" for each food item.

let foods = ['chips', 'dips', 'cereal'];

for (var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
  console.log('Add ' + foods[i] + ' to shopping list');
};

// YOU DO: Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to log double
// of each of the number. (Ex: 4 doubled is 8.)

let numbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i] * 2);
};

// YOU DO: Using the array of names below, print out "Happy Birthday <name>" for
// each name except the first two.
var names = ["Sevy", "Lindsey", "Jericho", "Raeonna", "Latrina", "Jhana", "Luca"];

for (var i = 2; i < names.length; i++) {
  console.log('Happy Birthday ' + names[i]);
};

// THE FINAL YOU DO: Using the array of ages below, print out a statement for each age.
// The age should determine which message is printed out:
  // Under 18? "Oh no, you can't vote quite yet."
  // 18 or over? "Make sure you get out and vote!"

// WORD FROM THE WISE: Before you start coding, jot down, with pen and paper, what steps you
// want to tell the program to take. Think of all the concepts you've learned so far.

// Remember, stuck for 15-20 minutes? Reach out to your pre-work group on Slack.

var ages = [17, 20, 34, 18, 16, 65, 49, 10, 22, 18];

//Brainstorm Process: create a loop where for each element, an If condition that checks age: if over 18, log the vote string. Else, log no vote string.

for (var i = 0; i < ages.length; i++) {                          //creates a loop going through each element in the ages array
   if (ages[i] >= 18) {                                          //checks if each element age is greater than or equal to 18
     console.log('Make sure you get out and vote!');             //logs the vote string if true
   } else {                                                      //creates a default if the 18 or older condition isn't met
     console.log('Oh no, you can\'t vote quite yet');            //logs the no vote string, using a \ to escape the apostrophe in the string
   }
};
