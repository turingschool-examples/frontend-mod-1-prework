//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Capybara");

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant")
console.log(animals[4]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ['Candy' , 'Candy Canes' , 'Candy Corn' , 'Syrup']

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(food.length)

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
food.push('broccoli')
console.log(food)

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
food.pop()
console.log(food)

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
food.unshift('Bananas' , 'Apples' , 'Carrots')
console.log(food)
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift
console.log(food)
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:Instagram: each individual post has multiple photos/videos
var individualPost = ["dog1" , "dog2" , "dog park" , "group photo"];
// 2:Gmail: each mail tab has an array of keywords to help sort mail into the correct tab
var socialInboxKeywords = ['Facebook' , 'Instagram' , 'tagged' , 'friend request'];
// 3:LinkedIn: Each user has an array of previous careers used to find relevant jobs/connections
var careerHistory = ['maintenance' , 'production' , 'technician' , 'facilities' , 'Historical Society'];

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

//Initial conditional will check if the battery is full enough to call an uber without issue
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  //If the conditional above is true it will return that an uber can be called.
  console.log("You can call an Uber.");
  //If false it will check if there is enough battery to call, and you can use a charger during the ride.
} else if (percentBatteryLeft >= 5 && (hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car")) {
  //If this stacked logical operator is true it will return an uber can be called, but it's risky.
  console.log("You can try to call an Uber, but you better hurry!");
  //If both the if and elseif conditionals return false it will default to the else statement.
} else {
  //The else statement will return that an uber can not be called.
  console.log("Time to start walking.");
};
//I recognize I altered the conditions slightly but I wanted to make full use of the charger variables

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
