//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.

var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE

console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.

console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals.splice( 2, 1, 'Gorilla' );

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.splice( 2, 0, 'Kudu');

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

//This is kind of a trick question, the array position was reassigned from 'Elephant' to 'Gorilla' two steps ago, so it isn't in the array. If this was just after the original array, it would be:

console.log(animals[2])

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

let foods = [ 'beans', 'berries', 'barley', 'cheese' ];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

foods.push('broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed

foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

let moreFoods = [ ...foods, 'cookies', 'carrots', 'cake']
foods = moreFoods
console.log(foods)

//the spread operator ...foods used above references the foods array without having to reference everything in it individually. It can also be used with iterables/array expressions/strings to represent where more arguments or elements would be expected. It can have more effects so if it's a multidimensional array, this method of concatenating wouldn't work, but for this purposes with array literals it's pretty sleek!  source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift()

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Facebook userPosts = ['status 1', 'status 2', 'etc.'']
// 2: Facebook friendsList = ['friend 1', 'friend 2', 'etc.']
// 3: Facebook notifications = ['alert 1', 'alert 2', 'etc.']

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

if (percentBatteryLeft > 15) {                          //checks if the percent of battery left is greater than 15%
  console.log('You can call an Uber!');                //tells the user they can call an uber if the above condition checks out
} else if (hasCharger && chargerType === 'car') {      //checks if they have both a charger and a cartype charger

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
