//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
var spliced = animals.splice(animals.length - 1, 1, 'Gorilla');
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push('Cat');
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
// I'm assuming this is a typo. Elephant was the element that was removed earlier, so I can't log it without re-adding it to the array.
// I'll go ahead and log the last element as I believe that's what you are wanting us to do here.
console.log(animals[animals.length - 1]);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var tastyThings = ['ramen', 'steak', 'pizza', 'dark-meat chicken'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(tastyThings.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
// but broccoli takes a lot of work to be tasty... :P
var pushed = tastyThings.push('broccoli');
console.log(tastyThings);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
// ahh, that's better
tastyThings.pop()
console.log(tastyThings);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
tastyThings.push('fondue', 'burgers');
tastyThings.unshift('carrots');
console.log(tastyThings);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
tastyThings.shift();
console.log(tastyThings);
// I am very happy the array only has tasty things in it now! :)
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:
var shoppingCart = ['milk', 'eggs', 'coffee'];
// 2:
var gists = ['session1_readings', 'session1_practice_tasks', 'session2_readings'];
// 3:
var browserHistory = ['github.com', 'gist.github.com', 'youtube.com', 'google.com'];

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger. // fixing typo on this line

*/
// the first condition: is the battery life at least 15
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  // if it is, nothing else matters, we can log the win msg
  console.log('Order da Uber now!!!');
  // if the battery life is insufficient, next condition: do we have a charger?
} else if (hasCharger === true) {
  // since we have a charger, nested condition: is the type of the charger car?
  if (chargerType === 'car') {
    // if we have a charger and it is a car charger, log the win msg
    console.log('Order da Uber now!!!');
    // if we have a charger but it is not a car charger
  } else {
    // log the unfortunate news
    console.log('You outta luck, NERD.')
    // this ends our check of whether hasCharger is true
  }
  // at this point, we are already past the check of battery life; this condition is checking if hasCharger is false
} else if (hasCharger === false) {
    // if hasCharger is false (and battery life is insufficient due to nesting of if statements), log the unfortunate news
    console.log('You outta luck, NERD.');
    // this ends the "does not have charger" check, and as there are no more conditions to test, this ends the entire if block
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
