## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I have been using the Pomodoro technique since first hearing about it in the Mod 0 prework so the idea was not new to me. I did however try planning what I would get done during each work segment and I think it helps me stay motivated. By setting (and achieving) goals it helps to stay motivated and keep pushing forward. It is also a good way of learning how long things take.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I was surprised at how I largely was hitting my goals pretty spot on. I found out that goals would slip near the end of larger work blocks ( every two to three hours) so I was able to learn when to take larger breaks to help reduce that fatigue and lag.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An `Object` stores more complex data than an array and is unordered. Whereas an array uses an index to locate and pull data an `Object` uses `key-value pairs` to link data values with key names. This helps create a more ordered data set that is also easier to add and take away from, plug functions into, and create classes with.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class    `Array` : Only one type of data is being stored (student names). An `Object` would be useful if you were storing all information about students.
  * List of states and their capitals   `Object` : It would be best practice to link each state with it's capital using `key-value pairs` to better categorize and pull the data.
  * List of things to pack for vacation   `Array` : This is a less intensive data-set where a single items don't need to be linked. An `Object` could be used in order to link items being packed with quantities for each item.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow    `Object` : An `Array` of names would be too clunky; an `Object` would allow for each name to be linked to a hyperlink to make accessing each account easier.
  * List of student names and their cohort    `Object` : Unlike the earlier list of students in class, this list requires two pieces of data be stored together.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake    `Object` : Each ingredient needs to be listed with the quantity necessary for a recipe. This would also allow for one to look up any ingredient and see how much is needed in the recipe.
  * All my favorite restaurants   `Array` : These are single items that would create this list; even if one were to use an `Object` it would only come out to containing various `Array` of different types of restaurants.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

The `News Feed` on my phone would create instances for each story displayed. Key value pairs would be:
```
body = "article page"
source = "webpage"
timeStamp = time submitted
```

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

So objects are defined as being 'unordered'. Does this mean you cannot pull a key-value pair using index numbers?
