# Day 6 Exercises

### Chapter 3
1. If you leave out the parenthesis, the function will not display because sayHello is different from sayHello().

2. For parameters, those words act at variables. For arguments, the code specifies real numbers that will be used to form a calculation.

3. Return is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

4. Local variables are better because they are only used for the function they are created within. Doing this saves memory and also keeps the function from running on other aspects of the web browser. I also cannot think of an instance at this moment as to when a global variable would be more useful, but hopefully that is something I can learn while at Turing.
