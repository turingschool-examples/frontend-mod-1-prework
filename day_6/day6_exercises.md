## Chapter 3 Questions and Answers:

1. **If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?**

- Entering sayHello would display the whole function, as that function is named sayHello

- Entering sayHello() would actually run the code in the code block, displaying 'hello' like the function was tasked

2. **What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?**

- Function parameters: These are used when a function needs information to work, written within parentheses following the function name. Inside of a function these parameters act as variable names.

- Arguments: Arguments are the values that you are passing into the code so that it can perform its function

3. **What is the keyword `return` used for?**

The keyword return is used to return a value to the code that called the function, such as the results of a performed calculation

4. **How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?**

Local variables are superior to global variables in that the browser has to remember a global variable so long as that web page is open, wear as local variables are only remembered while a function is being executed, using far less memory. You may want to use a global scoped variable when multiple functions will be using this variable
