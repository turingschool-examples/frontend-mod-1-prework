1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?

     ``sayHello() calls the function into being. just sayHello only returns the declaration of the function: "Hello!"``

2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

      ``The parameters are the type of variables the function is using, the arguments are the actual values you put into the code to perform the function``

3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?

      ``It makes the intrepreter leave the function and return to the statement that the return calls.``

4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

     ``local variables can only be used inside of the function where is is created. Global variables can be used anywhere in the code. Global variables take up more memory and can cause problems if not named correctly. If you need to call on a variable repeatedly in the code it would be a good time to use a global scope variable. ``
