## What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

## How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
  When you use local variables you don't have to worry about naming collisions and it uses less memory. A global variable would be good to use for things that are constant or if you need to use it in multiple functions that access the same data.
