Exercises: Functions
These exercises are based on the variables exercises, so you may start from those (your solutions or ours) or start from scratch.

The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

function tellFortune(kids, name, place, job)
{
 alert ("You will be a " + job + " in " + place +
", and married to " + name + " with " + kids + " kids.");


}

tellFortune(3, "shrek", "Norway", "pianist")
undefined
tellFortune(11, "Brad Pitt", "Norway", "director")
undefined
tellFortune(1, "Dracula", "Romania", "bloodbank manager")
undefined
tellFortune(7, "Dracula", "Romania", "bloodbank manager")

The Age Calculator
Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateAge that:
takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear){}
undefined
function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear){
var older = currentYear - birthYear;
var younger = older - 1;
return "You are either " + older + " or " + younger;
}
undefined
calculateAge(1967, 2019)
"You are either 52 or 51"
calculateAge(1975, 2050)
"You are either 75 or 74"
calculateAge(2000, 2095)
"You are either 95 or 94"
function calculateAgeThisYear(birthYear){
var older = currentYear - birthYear;
var younger = older - 1;
return "You are either " + older + " or " + younger;
}


The Lifetime Supply Calculator
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.


function calculateSupply(age, amount){
var maxAge = 104;
var lifeRemaining = maxAge - age;
var totalThings = amount * 365 * lifeRemaining;
return "You will need " + totalThings +
"to last you until the ripe old age of " + lifeRemaining;
}
undefined
calculateSupply(30, 15)
"You will need 405150to last you until the ripe old age of 74"
function calculateSupply(age, amount){
var maxAge = 104;
var lifeRemaining = maxAge - age;
var totalThings = amount * 365 * lifeRemaining;
return "You will need " + totalThings +
" to last you until the ripe old age of " + lifeRemaining;
}
undefined
calculateSupply(45, 3)
"You will need 64605 to last you until the ripe old age of 59"
function calculateSupply(age, amount){
var maxAge = 104;
var lifeRemaining = maxAge - age;
var totalThings = amount * 365 * lifeRemaining;
return "You will need " + totalThings +
" to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge;
}
undefined
calculateSupply(45, 3)
"You will need 64605 to last you until the ripe old age of 104"
