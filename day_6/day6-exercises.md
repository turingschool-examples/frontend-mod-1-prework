1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

sayHello() calls the function while sayHello just brings up the function without calling and executing it.

2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Parameters are the words that act like variables. Arguments are the values you pass into the code to be used to perform the calculation.

3. What is the keyword return used for?

return is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

Global variables are stored in memory for as long as a web page is loaded in the web browser thus using more memory than local variables and increasing the risk of naming conflicts. You may want to use global variables if the value isn't going to change and is used frequently.
