<p><b>If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console? </p></b>
<p> sayHello() being entered in the console will return what is in the parentheses of the function. Entering the function name will call the function, which runs the code. If you enter sayHello on its own, it will just return what the function sayHello looks like. </p>
<p><b>What is the difference between function parameters and arguments? </p></b>
<p> Function parameters are pieces of info that are passed to a function. Parameters are used when there is extra information needed to complete a task - like when calculating age, getting current year and birth year would be parameters. They act like variables when a function is decalred. Arguments are the values that are specified when calling a function with parameters. These values get passed to the code to calculate whatever is needed in the function. </p>
<p><b>What is the keyword return used for? </p></b>
<p> Return is used to return a value to the code that called the function. For example, if you are calculating someones age with the current year and their birth year, you can use the return keyword to return the calculation of that variable to the code. </p>
<p><b>How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local? </p></b>
<p> Local variables are better than global variables because they ensure there will be no issue with naming conflicts (it's ok to have two variables with same name if they are local), they take less memory than global variables, and they can have different values for each time a function is run which is untrue for global variables. If there are multiple functions that need to access the same variable data, then I think it would be preferable to use a global variable. </p>
