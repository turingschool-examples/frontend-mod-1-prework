1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
<br/> `sayHello` would have no return value while  `sayHello()`  would have the console print "Hello!".
2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
<br/>Parameters are the type of variable entered into a function and then used through the function as variables; while arguments are the actual value passed through to the function.
3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
<br/> `return` is used to give a number back calculated from the argument inputs.
4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
<br/>Local variables are able to be changed in a function, so if you run the function twice you can use different values. If you use a variable for multiple functions in the same program, it may make sense to use a global variable, for a constant such as pi for example.
