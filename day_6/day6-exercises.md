### 1. If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?

#### 1. Adding the parentheses to the function name will allow you to add statements to a code block that will perform the task. `sayHello()` is a function call and `sayHello` is a variable that would print the value of the variable.

### 2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

#### 2. Function parameters use words like width and height to declare the function. Function arguments specify real numbers that will be used to perform the calculation(or variables that hold real numbers).

### 4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

#### 4. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed. Global variables require the browser to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Global variables use more memory. It also increases the risk of naming conflicts. Using global variables might be better to use if you have exact measurements of an object to use and you know there will won't be any naming conflicts.
