Reading Questions:
1. I tried this in Chrome's console, and found that `sayHello` returns the function, while `sayHello()` actually calls it.
2. Parameters are the words inside the () that act like variables, while arguments are what gets passed into the function when it is called.
3. The `return` keyword is used to return a value. It also stops any code further down from it in the body of the function from running.
4. Local variables do not clog up the entire code base. They are only relevant inside of the function they were created in. Different functions can use variables with the same name without conflict when they are local. An instance where a global variable would be more useful could be a variable that would remain constant and need to be used frequently, maybe pi in a code base dealing with lots of circles.
