1.  **If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?**
 * The `sayHello()` is a valid way of calling a function. This will return "Hello!". just calling sayHello will return `ƒ`, the function type.
 ---
2.  **What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?**
 * Parameters: Parameters are the required information that a function needs.
 * Arguments: These are the values that are passed to the function.
 ---
3.  **What is the keyword `return` used for?**
 * The `return` keyword is used for breaking out of a function and passing the returned value or outcome back to the statement that called it.
 ---
4.  **How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?**
 * Local variables allow for reuse of the same variable each time the function runs and in separate functions.
 * A global variable would be useful if it was necessary for multiple different functions. I would say that a global variable would be something that is a constant and used often in lots of separate functions.
