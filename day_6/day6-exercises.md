1. The console would read sayHello as a variable whereas it would read sayHello() as a function. When I call the function sayHello(), it logs “Hello!” in the console. When I enter sayHello, it tells me what the entire text of the function is.

2. When a function is declared, it has parameters within the parentheses. When a function is called, it accepts arguments within the parentheses. Parameters are the placeholders and arguments are the variable data that is passed through.

3. The keyword return returns a value to the code that called the function. It specifies what the output will be.

4. With local variables, they can have different values if a function is run more than once. You can also use the same variable name inside of different code without causing conflict or errors. If you have a constant variable that will be used frequently in various parts of your site, you can use a global variable. If you have a site that refers to the reader by their name after they are asked to input it, it would be helpful for the variable to be global since it will be referenced in multiple functions to populate the page.
