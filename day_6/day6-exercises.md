<h3>If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?</h3>

When entering sayHello, the console returns '*sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}*'. When you run sayHello(), it returns 'Hello!'. I believe this because no parameters were given so the call to function never starts.

<h3>What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?</h3>

Function parameters, defined in the parentheses of the function name, use words to act like variable names inside the function. Arguments are defined in the parentheses when calling the function with real numbers to perform the calculation (or variables that hold real numbers). These values that you pass into the code are called arguments.

<h3>What is the keyword return used for?</h3>

The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

<h3>How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?</h3>

Local variables are better than global variables in a couple different ways. Firstly local variables require less memory than global variables because global variables will be stored in memory as long as the web page is loaded into the web browser. Global variables also increase the risk of naming conflicts. You would want to use a global variable when using the variable repeatedly and only using one Javascript file.
