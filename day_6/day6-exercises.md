## Chapter 3
1. The difference is that when you type `sayHello()` you are saying that this code is calling the function. Because you have declared the function, it will simply return `Hello!`. If you just type in sayHello then you are not calling the function and it will return all of the text after function `sayHello(){console.log("Hello")}`
2. Function parameters act like variables and provide more specific information to the function in order for it to perform its task. Function arguments are the values that the function should use if it has parameters. The arguments can be provided as values or variables.
3. The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.
4. Local variables are typically better than global variables because they take up much less memory, and therefore the web browser can load more quickly. Because the interpreter removes them after the function is run, this means that two different functions can use variables with the same name without having naming conflict. It is almost never better to use global variables, but one instance where it might be advantageous would be if you are dealing with a variable that is constant and never changes like gravity being 9.81.
