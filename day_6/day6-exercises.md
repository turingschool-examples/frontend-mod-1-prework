1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
Console prints out Hello! when calling function sayHello() and it prints out function {console.log("Hello!")} when entering sayHello.


2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
Parameters are names listed in function definition and arguments are real values passed into a function.

3. What is the keyword return used for?
It stops execution of a function and returns value.


4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
Global variables have global scope and are visible from anywhere in the code. It's better to use global variables when multiple function uses the same data. Local variables are defined inside the function and can only be visible/accessible by that function.
