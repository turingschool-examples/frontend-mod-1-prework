<h1>Day 6</h1>
<h2>1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?</h2>
<p>When you enter sayHello() it will print Hello! However, when you just enter sayHello it will not print anything.</p>
<h2>2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?</h2>
<p>Parameters act like variables for when a function needs specific information. They indicate what the function needs to know. An example of parameters for a function called fullName could be firstName and lastName. Arguments are the specific values that fill the parameters. An example of arguments for the fullName function could be Juliana and Ramirez.</p>
<h2>3. What is the keyword return used for?</h3>
<p>The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function. The result of the calculation is returned to the code that called it.</p>
<h2>4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?</h2>
<p>Local variables are usually preferred for several reasons. Local variables use less memory than global variables. Local variables also cut down on naming conflicts. Local variables also allow the variable to have different values if the function is run more than once. You might want to use a global variable if multiple functions need to access the same variable.</p>
