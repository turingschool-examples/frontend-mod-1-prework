## Chapter 3

## If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
A function with no following parentheses is being referenced. When parentheses follow a function, that function is being called.

## What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
Parameters use words that act like variables (e.g: width, height, etc). Arguments use variables that hold real numbers.

## What is the keyword return used for?
The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

## How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
Global variables are stored in memory for as long as the web page is loaded into the web browser. This means they take up more memory than local variables, and also increase the risk of naming conflicts. Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access.
