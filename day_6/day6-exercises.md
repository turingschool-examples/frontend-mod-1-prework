1. sayHello doesnt do anything, sayHello() calls the function and runs the code in the {}
  2. parameters are variables that exist in a function. Arguments give parameters an actual value, the value can be a direct value or a value as a variable.
  3. return sends the answer of the code block to the function.
  4. Local variables are better than global variables because local variables exist only within a function and global variables exist across the whole page which can lead to naming conflicts.
