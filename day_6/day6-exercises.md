If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

The function followed by () will actually run the code (or call the function). So entering sayHello() will return Hello!. Entering sayHello just returns the function declaration but does not actually run it.

What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Parameters are pieces of information you provide to a function in order for it to complete its assigned task. Arguments are the values or the specific information you tell a function that has parameters to use.

What is the keyword return used for?

The return keyword is used to return a value to the code from the function that was called.

How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

Local variables take up less memory and have a less of a risk for naming conflicts compared to global variables. A global variable might be useful if you know that you will need to access that variable constantly throughout your script and if you are confident you can come up with a unique name so that it won't conflict with other variables throughout your code.
