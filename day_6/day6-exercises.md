sayHello will call the code block and sayHello() will call the function

Function PARAMETERS act like variables
Function ARGUMENTS can be provided as values or variables

RETURN is used to return info to the code that called them.

LOCAL VARIABLES are better than GLOBAL VARIABLES when you want a variable to be used only within a certain function. You would want to use a GLOBAL VARIABLE when you want it to be used from anywhere outside of the function.
