# Day 6: JavaScript

## Open your local copy of frontend-module-0-capstone in Atom

In the day_6 directory, create another file called `day6-exercises.md`. This is where you'll put your answers to the following questions.




## Read part of Chapter 3 (Functions & Scope), pages 85-99, from [JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1541447422&sr=8-5&keywords=duckett)



Answer these questions about the reading in your `day6-exercises.md` file:



1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?

- the presence of paraenthesis makes it a function
- no parenthesis translates it into being a variable



2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

- Depite tendency to use them interchangeably, arguments are technically representations of expressions where real numbers are used in place of the parameters. 
- area = length * width uses the parameters, but when actual values are used in their place, 25sqft = 5ft * 5ft is now considered an argument



3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?

- 'return' is used to give the value of the function to the code that called it 
- When the interpreter reaches the 'return' keyword, it leaves the function disregarding anything that may have come after



4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

- local variables take up less memory because they only appear when their function is needed 
- global scoped variables are efficient when a variable is used heavily throughout the entire page, (if there are no conflicts within the code)




*   Work through [these problems](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNerd/JavaScriptForBeginners/exercises/functions.html) in the console about functions.\


*   Practice through some JavaScript basics exercises on [w3resource](http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php#EDITOR) and check your code against their solutions.
