### 1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
  Typing 'sayHello' will display the definition of the function, while 'sayHello()' actually calls the function and displays the result.

### 2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
  Parameters are input variables that need to be provided to a function to help it carry out it's intended functionality. The actual values provided by are referred to as arguments.

### 3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
  Return tells the function to return a value to whatever called the associated variable. This is often used to return the value of a variable that was used to store a result of various steps or calculations.

### 4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
  Local variables can hold several advantages depending on their use. They conserve memory as they do not need to constantly be held in memory for the duration of the program, rather only for the duration of the formula calculation. They also avoid name conflicts, as in a shared workflow, global variables could be defined multiple times if team members weren't in communication about the variables they were using. Alternatively however in that cooperative working situation, perhaps several team members might want to reference the same calculation results. Global variables would be useful in that situation.
