### 1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

The difference is that sayHello() will call the function to console.log 'Hello!'.  Entering sayHello without the () will not execute the function. It will simply say, sayHello.

### 2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Parameters are when you give a function specific information to perform its task.  Where as arguments are the values or variables used within the parameters.  Arguments are the information needed to perform the function using the previously set parameters.

### 3. What is the keyword return used for?

Return is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

### 4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

Local variables are better than global variables as they take up less memory than global variables.  Additionally, using global variables increases the risk of naming conflicts.  You may want to use a global variable in a small program where you may not run into an issue with naming conflicts.
