# Chapter 3 Javascript questions:

## 1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

  Entering sayHello without () in the console defines the function, while saying it with () invokes it.

## 2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

  Function parameters: The function parameters are place holders for the data to be passed to the function.

  Arguments: The data passed into the function.

## 3. What is the keyword return used for?

  The return keyword is used to return a value. This also ends the function.

## 4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

  Local variables are better than global variables because they avoid naming conflicts. An instance is when every function needs a variable that won't change or be removed.
