<h2>Chapter 3 (Functions & Scope)</h2>

<h3> If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?</h3>
<i> When you enter sayHello() you are calling a function. When you type sayHello you are just "recalling" the statement.</i>

<h3>What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?</h3>

<i> Parameters act as variables that have been set during function definition. Arguments are values that are given to the function when its being invoked</i>

<h3>What is the keyword return used for?</h3>

<i> Return keyword is used to stop the execution of a function and return a value to the code that called the function. </i>

<h3>How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?</h3>

<i>Local variables take up less memory space. With local variables you can use variables with same name without any naming conflicts. Local variable only affects the function its been declared in. I would think that if you want to use the same variable in multiple function without having to re-declare it you would want to use a global variable.</i>
