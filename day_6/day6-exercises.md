1. If we create a function to return "Hello" when it is called, we need to tell the function that we want it to run, which is done by including the parenthesis after the name of the function. If the parenthesis are left off, the code for the function will display instead of running the function.
2. Parameters are the types of information that a function needs in order to perform, such as height and width of an object that it will determine the area of. Arguments are the actual data that is needed to perform the function, such as the number of feet in the height and width. This could be expressed as actual data or by referencing a variable that will contain the data.
3. The keyword 'return' indicates that the function will stop running at that point and 'return' the value to the code that called it. Returning stops the function at the point at which it was called, and if there are other statements, they will not be processed.
4. Local variables are better than global variables for a few reasons. Local variables take up less memory, because the information is only stored while the function is running, and does not take up memory the rest of the time, unlike global variables, that are stored in permanent memory. With local variables, the variable can run more than once, with different values each time, whereas with a global variable, the values would remain the same. Local variables also allow for more than one variable to have the same name, which would not work with global variables. This could be extremely useful in long pieces of code, or when more than one person is working on the project. It seems that there might be instances when a global variable might be preferable, but only when the variable will not change perhaps if it needed to be used by several different functions, just because it would not need to be assigned over and over.
