Day 6



If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
> the latter contains a set of instructions.

 What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
>parameters contain words that act like variables, and arguments use real numbers or variables that hold real numbers.

 What is the keyword return used for?
> return produces a value for the function.

How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
> local variables are better than global because they operate inside of a function. It would be beneficial to use global variables if you need to run the variable more than once on one page.
