## 1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

The former will log the sayHello function. The latter will execute the sayHello function.

## 2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Parameters are the variable names that represent the function. Arguments are the actual values that will pass through the function.

## 3. What is the keyword return used for?

To return a value to the code that called the function.

## 4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

Usage of local variables helps reduce both memory load and risk of naming conflicts. If a variable needs to remain constant and get used by multiple functions, a global variable may be better to use.
