Ch. 3 Functions & Scope from JavaScript & jQuery

1. sayHello(); is a function name and the parentheses call the function
sayHello without parentheses is like a variable name

2. Function parameters are used like variables within the function
Arguments are the values that you pass into the code (the information it needs to function)

3. Return is used to determine the value the function returns

4. Local variables are better than global variables because they take up less memory and have no risk of naming conflicts
You might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local if you want to use it anywhere within the script
