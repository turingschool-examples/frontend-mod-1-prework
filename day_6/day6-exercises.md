**1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?**  
Entering `sayHello` returns the function itself. Entering `sayHello()` calls the function.

**2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?**  
Parameters are the variables that act as placeholders when the function is defined. The arguments are the values that are passed into the code when the function is called.

**3. What is the keyword return used for?**  
The return keyword returns a value to the code when the function is called.

**4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?**  
Local variables are better because they use less memory. They also allow a function to run multiple times with the variable having a different value each time. They can also avoid naming conflicts between two different functions. Global variables might be better if you want multiple functions to access the same variable.
