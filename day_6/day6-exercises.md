1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
The () in the sayHello() function makes it so that the console knows to pull from the previously defined function that brings with it the console.log command. Just typing in 'sayHello' just brings back the same text because
 the computer doesn't know what to do with the data.

2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
Function parameters are when you use names for your parameters such as "width" and "height" an argument is when you use the specific amounts for these variables like "5" and "7" when creating a function that calculates the area of a surface.

3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
The return command is used to bring back a calculation. If a function you have assigned performs one or more calculations using multiple variables the 'return' command is what tells the computer which numbers to keep or return for the user after the calculations are complete.

4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
A local variable is when you set your variables within the code of a function this makes it so your variable only applies within the function itself and does not apply outside. If you set your variables outside of the function this is global and can be used and recognized throughout your codebase. If you had a variable that is forever going to be static and will be used in calculations frequently throughout your program you would probably want to set it globally rather than locally just for ease of use and access while writing your code.
