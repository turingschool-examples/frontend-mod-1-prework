Answer these questions about the reading in your day6-exercises.md file:
If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
I am sorry, I did not understand the question (Is this asking what would happen if we plugged into the ("Hello")?) I messaged Robert too late on Tuesday for help. I thought the understanding would come to me. The () are required to declare a function is all I got. 

What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Function parameters are the pieces of information passed to a function, like the variables of a function. They are the items inside the () of the function. Names inside. The arguments are when the parameters are defined as values inside the (). Number inside.

What is the keyword return used for?

Return value is when you expect the function you created to provide an answer.

How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

The location where a variable is declared affects where it can be used in your code- this tis the variables scope. Local/function-level variables are created inside a function using the var keyword and do not work outside the declared function. Can assign different values every time its declared and no naming conflicts. Global variables with global scope are created outside the function and are stored in memory as long as the web page is loaded into the browser.
