1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
`sayHello` lists out the whole function, where as `sayHello()` returns the value `"Hello!"`

2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
Page 92- 93
Parameters act like variables and are inside the function.
Arguments are specified variables, such as real numbers. These pass on to the code for calculation.  

3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
`Return` is used to `return` to the function caller.

4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
Global variables use more memory and can cause name collisions. Page 98-99
No, because the book and internet highly discouraged it.
