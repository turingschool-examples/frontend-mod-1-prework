Chapter 3
1. The difference between sayHello and sayHello() is that one is a variable name and the other is a function.  We can determine if a defined element is a variable or a function by the parentheses at the end of the defined element.  A variable has no parentheses while the function has it.
2. Parameters uses variable names insides its function to make calculations.  Arguments can use both values or variables to make calculations.
3. The return keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.  The return function demonstrates how the same function can be used to perform the same steps with different values.
4. Local variables is created inside a function by using var keywords and global variable create variables outside of a function.  The key difference between the two is the creation of variables inside and outside of a function.  Local variable can be only used within a function, and global variables can be used throughout the script.  Global variables uses more memory, so it can take longer for a page to load.  One instance that I believe global variable can be useful over local variable is when you want to store data without the need to recalculate functions.  So, having stored calculation can be beneficial when a users need to return to the previously calculated result.
