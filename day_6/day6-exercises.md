If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

  * The difference between "sayHello" and "sayHello()" is that if you use "sayHello" anything that is in the parameters within the braces. "SayHello()" will recognize any text that is associated with that function. It is also the correct way to label a function name.

What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

  * With function parameters you are specifying the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name.

  * With arguments, they are the values that are passed into the code. It is the information needed to calculate the size of that particular wall.

What is the keyword return used for?

  * The *return* keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function

How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

  *  Local variables offer a guarantee that the values of variables will remain intact while the task is running. They are also deleted as soon as any function is over and release the memory space which it occupies.

  * With global variables, you can access the global variable from all the functions or modules in a program. It is useful when multiple functions are accessing the same data.It also tends to occupy a huge amount of memory.

  * The only instance that I would want to use a global scope would be if the value is constant. Also if you don't have  to add an additional parameter to function arguments and returns.
