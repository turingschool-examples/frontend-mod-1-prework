1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?

The sayHello() with parenthesis is the correct version as it gives the identifier (sayHello) a parameter. When I attempted to enter the code in the console without the parenthesis, it gave me an error code saying: Unexpected token '{'.

2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?

Items defined as parameters are variables that can be abstract, however arguments will be specific numbers.

3. What is the keyword return used for?

The return keyword finalizes the the function and defines the value that will be expressed when the function is performed.

4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

Local variables are beneficial when you are defining a specific action that is only relevant to certain functions within the code. Global variables can simplify code by defining certain values across the entire codebase, however it lacks specificity. Since a local variable has priority over global variables, setting a default error message or return message that is non-specific as a global variable would be a helpful instance instead of locally assigning the error message to each local setting.
