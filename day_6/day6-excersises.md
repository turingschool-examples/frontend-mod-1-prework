Chapter 3
1. If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
sayHello() is a function name. If different parts of a script repeat this same task then you can reuse this function rather than repeat the statement.

2. What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
The items that appear inside parenthesis are called parameters and act like variables. When you call a function that has parameters you specify the values it should use in the parenthesis that follow. The values are called arguments.

3. What is the keyword return used for?
 The keyword return is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

4. How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
Global variables take up more memory and increase the risk of naming conflicts. Local variables allow two different functions to use variables with the same name without any kind of naming conflicts.
