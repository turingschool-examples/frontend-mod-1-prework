1. In the space below, create a Car class with at least 2 attributes and 2 methods

   ```

     constructor(make, mileage, needGas) {
       this.make = make;
       this.mileage = mileage;
       this.needGas = needGas;
     }

     addMile() {
       this.mileage += 1;
     }

     lowGas() {
       this.needGas = true;
       console.log("Your gasoline levels are low. Please refill!");
     }
