Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

1. Psychology
How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

Good example: https://www.google.com/
- Google is constantly trying to improve its search processes so you can get to the information you need more quickly and with fewer words.

Bad example: https://www.ruelala.com/boutique/
- This website requires that you sign up for an account before it lets you see any other information. You can't even figure out what it is you're signing up for without giving them your email. That is too much work to ask of your user.

2. Usability
Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?

Good example: wikipedia.org
- Wikipedia is very straightforward. Ot has no distracting or slow to load bells and whistles.

Bad example: https://experienceform.com/
- The form festival website looks very nice, but it took me forever to navigate because it seems like the designer made the site with style in mind before usability. It is confusing and has far too many moving parts. 

3. Design
Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

Good example: https://arcteryx.com/us/en/
- The Arcteryx website is clean and minimal but clearly professional. The front page has samples of catchy merchandise, but it is also very clear where to find additional items.

Bad example: https://www.art.yale.edu/
- The Yale Art School website is unpleasant to look at and difficult to follow. The text sizes are all over the place and the moving background makes you dizzy.

4. Copywriting
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?

Good example: https://www.vox.com/
- A straightforward news site laid out on a grid pattern. Each article is evidently clickable with useful blurbs under each story.

Bad example: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html
- The Daily Mail website is a disorganized mess where it is difficult to tell the difference between an article and an ad. It is difficult to navigate as well.

5. Analysis
Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?

Good example: https://www.npr.org/
- An objective news site where opinion pieces are clearly labeled as such and all primary information provided is researched and relatively unbiased.

Bad example: https://www.breitbart.com/
- A right wing "news" site. This website phrases subjective observations as objective truths. It tries to get you to feel outraged without objective truth.
