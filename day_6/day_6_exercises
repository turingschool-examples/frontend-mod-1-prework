Chapter 3

1. If you enter sayHello into the console, it will literally return the function back to you. If you enter sayHello() it will actually perform or CALL the function for you and return "Hello!"
2. Parameters and arguments are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference. Parameters are the variables or placeholders used in a function (width, height) while arguments are the actual pieces of data used in the code (6, 8).
3. The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.
4. With local variables, two different functions can use variables with the same name without any kind of naming conflict. Global variables also take up significantly more memory than local variables. A situation in which you may use a global variable rather than a local variable is if you are working with true constants, or if a number of functions are using the same set of data.
