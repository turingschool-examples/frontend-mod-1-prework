// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var warning = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!';
console.log(warning);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = 'Connor';
var isHungry = true;
var numberOfPets = 2;
console.log(firstName + ' ' + isHungry + ' ' + numberOfPets);

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
var explanation = "my first name will always be a string. Hunger can be boiled down to yes or no (Boolean), and number of pets will always be a number.";
console.log(explanation);

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
firstName = 'Gordon';
isHungry = false;
numberOfPets = 3;
console.log(firstName + ' ' + isHungry + ' ' + numberOfPets);

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
console.log(healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks)
