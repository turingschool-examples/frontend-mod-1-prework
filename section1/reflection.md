## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
When I was in school for music, I was much better about giving myself breaks at specific times. I need to watch that to make sure I'm not just trying to work and work and work to get everything done. Taking breaks is very important! Admittedly, I also need to be eating a wider variety of foods with more fruits and veggies.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
string = any text in quotes, can be any character type
number = number
boolean = true or false, boolean logic, (also looks at truthy and falsy, not really gone over here)

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
`//`
purpose: either make your code easier for yourself/someone else to read
or: use to write your psuedocode

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like a box with a label on it that has something in it. The label should tell me what is in that box. What is in that box can change later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Three variables used on chess.com may be username (a string), blitzRating (a number, specifically an integer), and winLossDraws, an object with keys of wins, losses, and draws, each assigned an value of an integer.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is adding two strings together. They are added together in order. If there are other data types being concatenated, then type coercion kicks in and converts everything to a string. I suffered greatly on a complex problem in the JS work I've done before now because I needed to convert a number to a string which was nested in an array. Turns out it was much easier to add everything together into a string because of this very concept!

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Developers likely use concatenation to combine values you give to a website so that the data can be cleanly sent to the backend or to properly format a sentence with your name, age, etc.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
How do I use node to run JS code?
