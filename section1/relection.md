## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

// After reading, I've found that I read every day, usually the news, points 2 and 3 were fairly obvious to me, teaching others is something I've done in the past, taking care of my brain is something I'm striving to work on with a new plant-based diet, and I regularly take breaks to clear my mind.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

// Strings - Usually a string of characters and Numbers
// Booleans - True/False statements
// Numbers - Can either be whole numbers (integers) or decimals (Floats) to represent a quantity

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("""Hello World!"");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// The purpose is to label and/or describe the purpose of the code in question

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

// Variables are the items being used to modify the code

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

// Spotify search for music, rock, and band. Booleans for music and rock, string for band.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

// Concatenations join the script together to create a readable output.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

// Spotify results for a search in rock for Led Zepplin. 

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

// This is much more self-directed than I anticipated, and I understand why, however its simply taking much more time than I alloted for in September due to my child care needs. Not that its a problem, but I was expecting more instruction to more easily cope with the life/school balance, will there be more instruction in the modules to follow?
