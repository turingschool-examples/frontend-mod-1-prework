## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

    I think teaching others is really helpful in making you understand information and think about how best to explain it to someone else who might think differently, so you come at an idea from a really thorough understanding and reinforce your definitions and connections to that information every time. I want to take this into my learning by doing homework with my cohort peers and we can bolster each others' superlearning powers! I would add taking notes or having a system to remember or reference information. We have so much information these days about so many things, having systems to keep track of ideas and connecting them with the added benefit of positive study habits seems important.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

    1. number - an integer or float-point number
    2. boolean - true or false value (for a yes or no question)
    3. string - text or a series of symbols/number/text that all can be referenced as one entity

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

    `console.log('Hello World!');`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

 ```
  use comments to explain your code to other readers of it or yourself later  
  use // to make inline Comments
  use /*
     to make multiline
     Comments
     */
```
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    A variable is a shortcut name used to reference other data you want to keep track of. For example, if I have a really long number, instead of typing it out every time I could just call it 'longNumber'. Or if it's a set of names, I want to reference all of them as a set instead of writing each individual one, so I could make an array with a name like 'beanieBabies'.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

    I use Slack. It has username (a string), password (a string) and online status (a boolean).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

    A concatenation is adding or joining variables together, no matter their data type. So instead of addition just being used for math, you can add text or booleans together into a new string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

    Email addresses signup requires a unique user name input from the user, but then they concatenate their own '@emailservice.com'

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

    When is it best to use '==' vs '==='?
    Is there a way to access my atom.exe from an Ubuntu subsystems in Windows 10?
