## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really enjoyed the SuperLearner Article, and I find it a very good aid in learning how to learn. The idea that learning is a process, adopting a growth mindset, and teaching others what you know are all things I feel I do already. I never thought much on the importance of diet in my own life and learning, so that is something I am more conscious of, as well as trying to read more and learning how to work in a sustainable manner (by taking short breaks every 30-50 minutes). I also think that being open to new things and experiences is an important part of learning that I don't think was specified in the article.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number: a data type that handles all positive, negative, and decimals. Written without commas and later divided into Integers and Floats. <45, -68752, 25.50>
String: a data type that consists of letter and other characters, wrapped in single or double quotes. <"this is a string">
Boolean a data type that evaluates to one of two values, true or false. < 6 === 6 //true>

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

<console.log("Hello World!");>

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

<//> A code comment is used to help explain code to others who may work on the code. It can also block out certain code snippets to troubleshoot.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable stores data to be reused later. So if you made a drawing we can make a copy of it every time we want to send it to someone instead of having you draw it all over again.
<var drawing = "The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci created in 1503">

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

var username = String
var password = String
var passwordCheck = Boolean (Does input === storedPassword)
var devicesLoggedIn = Integer

---

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

It's a combining of data into a single entity.

---

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Any site that has you log in and returns a <"Welcome, " + username + "!">

---

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

How is concatenation used apart from math problems and user experience (see above answer)? I know it is I just can't think of any actual examples.
